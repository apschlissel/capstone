296,996,"9,029",The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood of Great Renown in Nottinghamshire is an  novel by the American illustrator and writer Howard Pyle Consisting of a series of episodes in the story of the English outlaw Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men the novel compiles traditional material into a coherent narrative in a colorful invented old English idiom that preserves some flavor of the ballads and adapts it for children The novel is notable for taking the subject of Robin Hood which had been increasingly popular through the th century in a new direction that influenced later writers artists and filmmakers through the next centuryPyle had been submitting illustrated poems and fairy tales to New York publications since  and had met with success The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood was the first novel he attempted He took his material from Middle Age ballads and wove them into a cohesive story altering them for coherence and the tastes of his child audience For example he included Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar in the narrative order to reintroduce Friar Tuck He needed a cooperative priest for the wedding of outlaw Allan a Dale Pyles spelling of the original AlanaDale to his sweetheart Ellen In the original A Gest of Robyn Hode the life is saved of an anonymous wrestler who had won a bout but was likely to be murdered because he was a stranger Pyle adapted it and gave the wrestler the identity of David of Doncaster one of Robins band in the story Robin Hood and the Golden Arrow In his novelistic treatment of the tales Pyle thus developed several characters who had been mentioned in only one ballad such as David of Doncaster or Arthur a Bland  Pyles book continued the thcentury trend of portraying Robin Hood as a heroic outlaw who robs the rich to feed the poor this portrayal contrasts with the Robin Hood of the ballads where the protagonist is an outandout crook whose crimes are motivated by personal gain rather than politics or a desire to help others For instance he modified the ballad Robin Hoods Progress to Nottingham changing it from Robin killing fourteen foresters for not honoring a bet to Robin defending himself against a band of armed robbers Pyle has Robin kill only one man who shoots at him first Tales are changed in which Robin steals all that an ambushed traveler carried such as Robin Hood and the Bishop of Hereford so that the victim keeps a third and another third is dedicated to the poor  Pyle did not have much concern for historical accuracy but he renamed the queenconsort in the story Robin Hood and Queen Katherine as Eleanor of Aquitaine This made her compatible historically with King Richard the LionHearted with whom Robin eventually makes peace  The novel was first published by Scribners in  and met with immediate success ushering in a new era of Robin Hood stories It helped solidify the image of a heroic Robin Hood which had begun in earlier works such as Walter Scotts  novel Ivanhoe In Pyles wake Robin Hood has become a staunch philanthropist protecting innocents against increasingly aggressive villains Along with the publication of the Child Ballads by Francis James Child which included most of the surviving Robin Hood ballads Pyles novel helped increase the popularity of the Robin Hood legend in the United States The Merry Adventures also had an effect on subsequent childrens literature It helped move the Robin Hood legend out of the realm of penny dreadfuls and into the realm of respected childrens books After Pyle Robin Hood became an increasingly popular subject for childrens books Louis Rheads Bold Robin Hood and His Outlaw Band  and Paul Creswicks Robin Hood  illustrated by Pyles pupil N C,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"[0.04621046409010887, 0.13617829978466034, 0.021337786689400673, 0.03205060958862305, 0.02552720531821251, 0.047119371592998505, 0.1319485455751419, 0.19231411814689636]"
