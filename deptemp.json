Jesus emphasized the deep, underlying messages of the gospel; and this same message is continued through the apostle Paul and the writer of Hebrews. Relationships of faith empower us to live the covenant and spread the gospel message. The writer of the student book lessons is Kevin Baker; the teacher book writer is Timothy Bryan.</p>\n<p><strong>A Fulfilled Covenant</strong><br>\nThe first unit, in four lessons, reveals a new sign of the covenant for Jewish and Gentile believers, as recorded in Matthew, Mark, Luke, Hebrews, and Colossians. During the celebration of the Passover, Jesus explained to the disciples that he would initiate a new covenant through his death. Paul explains that the sign of the covenant is now a relationship of the heart between God and God's people, not circumcision.</p>\n<p><strong>A Heartfelt Covenant</strong><br>\nThe four lessons in this unit give new meaning and purpose to the Law. According to Matthew, Jesus began teaching the Law in a way that gave life to the hearer and the doer. Unlike other teachers of the Law, Jesus preached the transforming righteousness of the Kingdom. Jesus challenged the mere external observance of God's law without internal transformation.</p>\n<p><strong>Covenant: A Personal Perspective</strong><br>\nThe four lessons in this unit focus on personal relationships between people in 1 Samuel, Ruth, and Ephesians. Ultimately, those relationships pave the way for the Messiah. After Christ established the New Testament church, relationships between people have been based on relationship with Christ Jesus. These relationships continue the work of Christ Jesus by spreading the gospel message. </p>\n<p>Hundreds of thousands of students and teachers use <em>Adult Bible Studies</em> each week in Sunday school classes, mid-week Bible studies, and other small group settings.

I passionately believe that very few ministers genuinely understand the role of the Chaplain or have come to accept this office as being part of the five-fold ministry, hence, the goal for this book- to educate all who are interested in this calling and to validate the position as a unique fac-et of the five-fold ministry. As most astute Christians have realized through scripture, and by the obvious design of the church the five-fold “gift ministers” are a vital part of the Church (i.e., an apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, teacher), and are instrumental in fulfilling the mission of the church today. Chaplains who fulfill the above roles in such places as hospitals, prisons, military installations, corporations, and vessels are a critical part of their assigned stations. They merit re-spect. The Bible never explicitly describes the role of the Chaplain or the vital purpose of Chap-laincy; nevertheless, the office is equivalent to that of a pastor and is an essential part of the body of Christ-they play a vital role in society. Unfortunately, it is rather annoying to see a fair amount of folks that minimize the role of a chaplain or who are merely ignorant of this critical office until they become incarcerated, hospitalized, or experience a crisis while in an academic or military set-ting. Church leadership has not made an adequate effort to educate their congregations about the valuable role of the local Chaplain who toils tirelessly with little acknowledgment or gratitude from the local church; Thus, this book was written to educate and instruct those who are interest-ed in pursuing the office of chaplaincy-to teach the more exceptional subtleties of Chaplaincy from an individual who has been involved in Chaplaincy for over 30 years and secondly provide an inside view of the very practical day to day functions of hospital chaplaincy. Although there are several different kinds of chaplains (i.e., military, prison, and academic) the chief focus of this book will be on hospital chaplaincy from my personal experiences as both a chaplain and therapist.</p>","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/92/9781664220492.jpg","edition":2,"pages":300,"date_published":"20210127","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Chaplain Eddie Olivas M.A."],"title":"Almost Everything You Need to Know About Hospital Chaplaincy","isbn13":"9781664220492","msrp":"27.95","binding":"ePub","isbn":"1664220496"},{"publisher":"R.H.

The four lessons for March help us examine how God defines holiness, how holiness is nourished, what holiness means in terms of sexual morality, and how we ought to pray.

We examine these stories, not to wallow in misery, but to understand them as context for hope and salvation. </p>\n<p><strong>Salvation</strong><br>\nScripture - Mark 15:22-39 | Matthew 28:1-10 | Haggai 2:1-9 | Mark 1:1-8<br>\nSpiritual Practice - Generosity<br>\nSuffering, the theme connecting the lessons in our first unit this quarter, is not the end of our story when God is involved with us. Thus, this second unit is about salvation. Over its four lessons, we will look at the new start for the people of Judah represented by the rebuilding of the Temple in Haggai's time and the new start for humankind announced by John the Baptist and accomplished through the death and resurrection of Jesus, &mdash;new starts made\npossible by God's initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>Grace</strong><br>\nScripture - Revelation 22:1-5 | Genesis 3:21; 4:10-16 | Exodus 16:2-15 | Luke 23:32-33, 39-43 | Acts 2:1-21<br>\nSpiritual Practice - Service<br>\nThe first unit in this quarter began with the expulsion from the garden of Eden, the loss of paradise. With this unit, in Lesson 10, we see the Bible's prophecy of the return to paradise, the kingdom of God, made possible by God's grace. The other four lessons of this unit identify points in Scripture at which God's grace was also operative, reminding us that grace is an ongoing force in life for the faithful today as well.</p>\nPublished quarterly, each week's student book lesson features key verses, reliable and relevant biblical explanation and application, and more.

This has come at the expense of the faith truths, beliefs and perspectives offered by women, people of colour, indigenous theologies and the working classes, whose testimonies have often been ignored or marginalised by the dominant discourses that have been deemed more trustworthy as a consequence of the way in which imperialism has enabled knowledge and religion to be constructed and controlled.Yet theological education also has a potential to challenge these norms. It holds the potential to challenge oppressive cultures, theologies and pedagogies.Relying on feminist, black, indecent, and postcolonial theologies, Trust in Theological Education will deconstruct dominant models of theological education, by incorporating ethnographic research, alongside educational theory, liberation theology and radical exegesis’. It will demonstrate theological educations potential to change, and be transformed in order to enable those who have been excluded and marginalised to become speaking subjects and agents for systemic change.","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/65/9780334061465.jpg","edition":3,"pages":200,"date_published":"20220531","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Eve Parker"],"title":"Trust in Theological Education","isbn13":"9780334061465","msrp":"50.0","binding":"ePub","isbn":"0334061466"},{"publisher":"Hymns Ancient & Modern LTD","synopsis":"It is no surprise that Christians have long been involved in education - the quest for human flourishing and wholeness is at the heart of the gospel, and education is critical to that quest.

But what is surprising is our theological silence in the face of the deep injustices which lie at the heart of our education system.In Inequality and Flourishing, Mariama Ifode-Blease explores and exposes these inequalities, and calls for a greater remembrance of the bountiful and daunting gift of stewardship we have as we educate young people.Drawing on interviews, she offers a fresh vision of education as being about giving children the best tools to be stewards of their minds and bodies, our communities and ultimately our planet.","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/64/9780334060864.jpg","edition":3,"pages":200,"date_published":"20220630","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Mariama Ifode- Blease"],"title":"Inequality and Flourishing","isbn13":"9780334060864","msrp":"50.0","binding":"ePub","isbn":"0334060869"},{"publisher":"Abingdon Press","synopsis":"Journey 101 Serving God is one component of <i>Journey 101: Knowing, Loving, Serving God</i>.

Tools such as e-mail, Web browsers, and on-line conferencing present exciting opportunities for both adult learners and their instructors. The purpose of this volume of New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education is to explore the effects of the Internet on adult learning--both as that learning is facilitated through formal instruction and as it occurs spontaneously in the experiences of individuals and groups--and to provide guidance to adult and continuing educators searching for ways to use the Internet more effectively in their practice. Taken as a whole, the sourcebook provides a thorough survey of the research literature. The chapters also reflect the hard-won personal experiences of the authors, all of whom are directly involved in the use of Internet technologies to facilitate adult learning. This is the 78th issue of the quarterly journal New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education.

While sensible Elinor falls in love with Edward Ferrars, her romantic sister Marianne is courted by both the handsome Willoughby and the hideous man-monster Colonel Brandon. Can the Dashwood sisters triumph over meddlesome matriarchs and unscrupulous rogues to find true love? Or will they fall prey to the tentacles that are forever snapping at their heels?

In Back Pocket God, Melinda Lundquist Denton And Richard Flory Provide A Look Beyond Conflicting Stories That Argue That Emerging Adults Are Either Overwhelmingly Leaving Religion, Or That They Are Earnest Spiritual Seekers Maintaining A Significant Place In Their Lives For Religion. Denton And Flory Show That While The Dominant Trend Among Young People Is A Move Away From Religious Beliefs And Institutions, There Is Also A Parallel Trend In Which A Small, Religiously Committed Group Of Emerging Adults Claim Faith As An Important Fixture In Their Lives. Yet, Whether Religiously Committed Or Not, Emerging Adults Are Increasingly Personalizing, Customizing And Compartmentalizing Religion In Ways That Suit Their Idiosyncratic Desires. For Emerging Adults, God Has Become Increasingly Remote Yet Is Highly Personalized To Meet Their Particular Needs. In The Process, They Have Transformed Their Conception Of God From A Powerful Being Or Force That Exists Out There To Their Own Personal Pocket God--a God That They Can Carry Around With Them, But That Exerts Little Power Or Influence In Their Daily Lives.

Henry's Father, Believing Catherine To Be Wealthy, Invites Her To Be A Guest At Northanger Abby, The Family's Country Estate. Catherine, Who Has Read Too Many Gothic Romances And Who Is Possessed Of Too Vivid An Imagination, Views The Abbey As A House Of Nightmarish Horror — An Aspect Of The Book That Gleefully Parodies The Fantastic Gothic Romances By Ann Radcliffe And Other Popular Writers Of The Period. An Amusing Assortment Of Misunderstandings And Plot Twists Result In The Satisfying Romantic Conclusion Characteristic Of The Author’s Works. First Written In 1789-99, When Austen Was In Her Early Twenties, This Novel, Like Persuasion, Did Not See Publication Till 1818, In The Winter After The Author's Death. Distinguished By Its Satirical Wit, Brilliant Comedy, And Complex But Subtle Views Of Human Nature And Morality, The Book Also Presents A Fine Background Picture Of Middle-class Life In Nineteenth-century England, With Particularly Good Scenes In Bath, The Fashionable Watering Place To Which Austen's Father, A Clergyman Himself, Had Retired.

If I See Myself As An Unwilling Detective With A Desire For Justice, Is Her Illness An Unsolved Crime? If So, Who Is The Villain And Who Is The Victim? Sofia, A Young Anthropologist, Has Spent Much Of Her Life Trying To Solve The Mystery Of Her Mother's Unexplainable Illness. She Is Frustrated With Rose And Her Constant Complaints, But Utterly Relieved To Be Called To Abandon Her Own Disappointing Fledgling Adult Life. She And Her Mother Travel To The Searing, Arid Coast Of Southern Spain To See A Famous Consultant--their Very Last Chance--in The Hope That He Might Cure Her Unpredictable Limb Paralysis.

This Unique And Vivid Portrait Of An Era Marred By Racial Segregation And Relentless, Daily Injustices Is Nonetheless Rendered With Love And Longing For A Time And Place That Was Enriched By A Vibrant, Burgeoning, And Widely Influential African American Culture And A Fierce Feeling For Family And Community. Amerigo Is Just Discovering, But Not Really Understanding, Racial Prejudice. Like Any Growing Boy, He Is Also Learning About Sexuality, Art, Literature, And Life Itself. He Is A Dreamer, And Yet It Is Clear That Many Of His Dreams Will Not Come True, Not Because Of Who He Is, But Because Of The Color Of His Skin. Completed In The 1960s, Vincent Carter Was Unable To Find A Publisher For His Ambitious Book, In Part Because It Did Not Fit What Publishers Were Looking For In The Way Of Negro Literature. But When Richard Wright's Widow, Ellen, Read It, She Could Hardly Contain Her Enthusiasm, And Finally Said Simply That Such A Tableau Of Childhood By A Black Man Had Never Been Done. By 1970 Carter Had Given Up Trying To Find A Publisher. He Died In 1983, And His Work Came Perilously Close To Disappearing Without A Trace.--book Jacket. Vincent O.

The Modern Library Has Played A Significant Role In American Cultural Life For The Better Part Of A Century. The Series Was Founded In 1917 By The Publishers Boni And Liveright And Eight Years Later Acquired By Bennett Cerf And Donald Klopfer.

Primo was an enigmatic drifter, author of a pornographic novel and ex-lover of an eclectic collection of girlfriends; it seems he even had a child. Mary's own life is nothing to write home about. She's 29 years old and has been working a succession of temp jobs while making fitful attempts at finishing a collection of short stories. On Primo's trail, she stumbles into a series of new adventures. In search of one of Primo's many ex-girlfriends, she arrives at a band audition and accidentally becomes a bassist in an all-woman band, the Beautiful and the Crazy. Other forays land her dates with a toe-sucking foot fetishizer and a borderline rapist. Finally, she meets a marginally more suitable tattooed hipster while walking Primo's dog, Numb. Meanwhile, she is being wined and dined by Joey, an older man who once lived next door to her parents in New Jersey. As it happens, it is Joey, and not Primo, whose secrets will ultimately matter the most to Mary. As the coincidences mount, Mary tries to make sense of them, ultimately realizing that life is just \"a series of battles and treaties.\" Nersesian (The Fuck-up) knows downtown Manhattan's East Village life better than most, and his characters are instantly recognizable, if somewhat cartoonish. But his tongue-in-cheek humor and uneven prose may limit the novel's readership to the slacker denizens it chronicles. (Oct.)

Authentic discipleship involves imitating Jesus, and we must begin with an understanding of Jesus as Messiah and the kingdom to which he invites us to belong. We soon discover as we follow Jesus that his kingdom turns our expectations totally upside down. As we walk with Jesus, we must admit that we sometimes totally miss the mark. Yet Christ forgives us, restores us, and equips us to live into our identities as Christ-followers.<br>\nAs his followers, we have responsibilities and opportunities to help grow the kingdom. One way is through stewardship, a concept that is much broader than we may think. Our role involves using not only our physical resources but indeed our very lives as grace-filled cohabitants in God&rsquo;s marvelous creation.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Unit 1: The Mark You Make</strong><br>\nDiscipleship in Mark&rsquo;s Gospel is often described as the way of the cross because of the repeated emphasis upon following Jesus on the way to Jerusalem and the command to take up one&rsquo;s cross and follow Jesus (Mark 8:34). In this season when we commemorate Jesus&rsquo; journey to Jerusalem, we give our attention to various aspects of discipleship we find in Mark&rsquo;s Gospel.<br>\n<br>\nScriptures: Mark 8:27-38; Mark 9:38-50; Mark 10:35-45; Mark 11:12-14, 20-25; Mark 13:5-8, 28-37; Mark 14: 27-42; Mark 16:1-8<br>\n<br>\nSpiritual Practice: Reflection and self-examination<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Unit 2: The Steps You Take</strong><br>\nCreation care has become a prominent topic of discussion in Christian congregations and seminaries during the last couple of decades. While disagreement exists about human responsibility for climate change and to what extent we should limit human activity for the purpose of preservation of endangered species and habitats, Scripture makes clear that God takes pleasure in creation and that our role as stewards requires that we appreciate creation and take our responsibility as stewards seriously.<br>\n<br>\nScriptures: Psalm 104; Leviticus 25:1-13; Deuteronomy 14:22-29; Job 38:4-11; Joel 2:18-26; Romans 8:19-22; 2 Corinthians 9<br>\n<br>\nSpiritual Practice: Nurture and care of all creation<br>\n<em>Adult Bible Studies</em> components include:<br>\nStudent Book<br>\nPublished quarterly, each week's Student Book lesson lists background Scripture, features key verses, provides reliable and relevant biblical explanation and application, and more, in a readable font size that is accessible to everyone.<br>\n<br>\nTeacher Book/Commentary Kit<br>\nEach quarterly Teacher/Commentary Kit includes a Teacher Book with additional biblical background and exposition and suggestions for guiding group discussion and a copy of the new quarterly <em>Adult Bible Studies</em> Concise Commentary, designed for readers who seek additional background on the biblical text for each session of <em>Adult Bible Studies</em>.<br>\n<br>\nVideo-DVD<br>\nDoes your group enjoy watching videos to generate conversation around Bible studies?

It's only when we get to Lesson 4 that the new creation theme emerges. But after the journey the first three lessons takes us through, the need for a fresh start is obvious, and the message of restoration that God announces through Hosea is most welcome. </p>\n<p><strong>A New People</strong><br>\nScripture - Jeremiah 23:1-8 | Daniel 1:8-17 | Daniel 3:19-30 |Nehemiah 9:9-17, 32-33<br>\nSpiritual Practice - Prayer<br>\nWhile the Lord invites all to be people of God, the Old Testament is essentially the story of God's dealings with a specific group of people, the Israelites. The four lessons of this unit give us an opportunity to look at some key stories related to those dealings: God and the remnant, the community's connection to God, God's care for the people in a time of great stress, and how God's love for the people continued despite their unfaithfulness. All these stories have applications to us today, but we begin to learn about God's ways through biblical stories about God and the Israelites.</p>\n<p><strong>A New Way of Life</strong><br>\nScripture - Luke 19:1-10 | John 4:7-30, 39-42 | Luke 10:25-37 | Matthew 15:21-28 | Mark 5:1-20<br>\nSpiritual Practice - Hospitality<br>\nThe Bible passages in the five lessons of this unit are all intended to enlarge our understanding of the word neighbor. Four of the five are incidents that directly involve Jesus, and the fifth is a parable Jesus told expressly to show what it means to be a neighbor, the parable we call the parable of the good Samaritan. All these passages are important, for they elucidate Jesus' summary statement of one of the two most important commandments: \"You must love your neighbor as you love yourself\" (Matthew 22:39).  </p>\nThis ongoing day-by-day Bible study series is a great companion to <em>Adult Bible Studies</em> but can also be used as a standalone study for anyone wanting daily time with God.

But you may lack the tools and experiences to create the nurturing home you do want: a place where your children's physical and emotional needs are consistently met and where your children feel safe, valued, and loved.<p>In Healthy Parenting, Janet Woititz, a leading therapist, contrasts what happens in a healthy family with what happens in an unhealthy family to show just how your own upbringing influences the way you raise your children, and what you can do to make their upbringing better for them. For example:<br>-- In a healthy family the child is always loved even if the child's behavior is unacceptable. In an unhealthy family not only is the behavior criticized but the child is shamed as well.<br>-- In a healthy family the parent is teacher and guide. In an unhealthy family the child brings himself up the best he can.<br>-- In a healthy family there is structure, and reasonable limits are set. In an unhealthy family there is chaos or extreme rigidity.</p><p>As both therapist and parent, Janet Woititz can give you the guidance you missed in your childhood and help you avoid the mistakes your parents made.</p>                        <p>The bestselling author of Adult Children of Alcoholics provides compassionate, practical advice for adult children who are often overwhelmed by parenthood.

In 2020, we reintroduced printed focal Bible passages in both the Student and Teacher books. Lessons follow the church seasons, including Advent and Lent, and include suggestions for developing spiritual practices to help nurture your faith.<br><br><b><i>Adult Bible Studies </i></b><b>Fall 2021</b><br><b>Theme: Belong</b><br><br><b>Unit 1: Outside In</b><br>Sociologists studying the story of the early church often attribute the growth of the church to the sense of belonging that it offered people in a world where belonging was limited to those with things such as property, high status, and/or birthright. This unit of lessons looks at the various ways that the Bible makes clear how we belong to God’s people even when we appear to be outsiders. Several of the lessons point out where we as human beings insert distinctions that restrict membership within the community of Christ.<b></b><br> <br><b>Scriptures: </b>Jeremiah 29:1-23; Luke 7:36-50; Galatians 2:11-21; Philippians 3:2-21; Ephesians 2:19-21 <b></b><br> <br><b>Spiritual Practice:</b> Hospitality<br><b> </b><br><b>Unit 2: Into the Future </b><br>After over 2000 years of existence as an institution, we can easily take for granted that we know what the church is. This unit invites readers to look at it from the view of the community living into the future. The Greek word for church, e<i>kklesia</i>, is not a word that the first members of the church associated with a religious activity. The word signifies the assembly of the people of God. It is instructive to look at what their understanding of the purpose of assembling as a group signified, how it has shaped our understanding of church, and how reading these texts might renew and expand our understanding. <br><b> </b><br><b>Scriptures: </b>Acts 2:37-47;1 Corinthians 12:12-31; Matthew 16:13-19; Revelation 3:1-6, 14-20; Deuteronomy 29:10-29 <b></b><br><b> </b><br><b>Spiritual Practice: Community </b><br><b> </b><br><b>Unit 3: The Fellowship of the Table</b><br>Once one enters the Church through baptism, the central identity marker for membership in the church is participation in Communion. The opening of God’s people to both Jews and Greeks, men and women, masters and slaves required people previously unaccustomed to eating together to sit down at a common table. When we look at the Gospel narratives, we see Jesus modeling open table fellowship. In this unit, we will look at the significance of the practice of open table fellowship in the church as a sign of God’s shared abundance, ministry of reconciliation, and celebration.<b></b><br><b> </b><br><b>Scriptures: </b>John 6:1-15; 1 Samuel 25:2-39; 1 Corinthians 11:17-34; Isaiah 25:6-10a; 55:1-3<b></b><br><b> </b><br><b>Spiritual Practice: </b>Open Table Fellowship<br><br>  <br>Adult Bible Study components include:<br>Student Book<br> Published quarterly, each week's Student Book lesson lists background Scripture, features key verses, provides reliable and relevant biblical explanation and application, and more, in a readable font size that is accessible to everyone.<br><br>Teacher Book<br>The Teacher Book provides small-group leaders with additional biblical background and exposition and suggestions for guiding group discussion for each quarterly theme. <br><br>Video-DVD <br>Does your group enjoy watching videos to generate conversation around Bible studies?

We will mostly use the Common English Bible (CEB) version of the text, while sometimes including the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) when it will better help students engage and appreciate the biblical texts.\n<p><strong> Summer Theme:<br>\nCommunity</strong><br>\nThis summer, our lessons support the theme of \"Community.\" The writer of the student book lessons is Robert Gardner; the teacher book writer is Martha Myre.</p>\n<p><strong>A New Thing</strong><br>\nSpiritual Practice - Study<br>\nScripture - Deuteronomy 8:1-10 | 1 Kings 18:20-39 | 2 Kings 22:8-20 | Hosea 1:2-11<br>\nIf you look at the texts of this unit in the sequence they are laid out over the four lessons, it may not be immediately apparent why the unit theme is \"A New Thing.&rdquo; While Lesson 1 presents God';s charge to ancient Israel to keep the commandments, Lessons 2 and 3 focus on incidents brought about by the people failing to keep the commandments, and Lesson 3 adds the note of divine judgment. It's only when we get to Lesson 4 that the new creation\ntheme emerges. But after the journey the first three lessons takes us through, the need for a fresh start is obvious, and the message of restoration that God announces through Hosea is most welcome. </p>\n<p><strong>A New People</strong><br>\nScripture - Jeremiah 23:1-8 | Daniel 1:8-17 | Daniel 3:19-30 |Nehemiah 9:9-17, 32-33<br>\nSpiritual Practice - Prayer<br>\nWhile the Lord invites all to be people of God, the Old Testament is essentially the story of God's dealings with a specific group of people, the Israelites. The four lessons of this unit give us an opportunity to look at some key stories related to those dealings: God and the remnant, the community's connection to God, God's care for the people in a time of great stress, and how God's love for the people continued despite their unfaithfulness. All these stories have applications to us today, but we begin to learn about God's\nways through biblical stories about God and the Israelites.</p>\n<p><strong>A New Way of Life</strong><br>\nScripture - Luke 19:1-10 | John 4:7-30, 39-42 | Luke 10:25-37 | Matthew 15:21-28 | Mark 5:1-20<br>\nSpiritual Practice - Hospitality<br>\nThe Bible passages in the five lessons of this unit are all intended to enlarge our understanding of the word neighbor. Four of the five are incidents that directly involve Jesus, and the fifth is a parable Jesus told expressly to show what it means to be a neighbor, the parable we call the parable of the good Samaritan. All these passages are important, for they elucidate Jesus' summary statement of one of the two most important commandments: \"You must love your neighbor as you love yourself\" (Matthew 22:39).  </p>\nPublished quarterly, each week's student book lesson features focal Bible passages, reliable and relevant biblical explanation and application, and more.

Jesus emphasized the deep, underlying messages of the gospel; and this same message is continued through the apostle Paul and the writer of Hebrews. Relationships of faith empower us to live the covenant and spread the gospel message. The writer of the student book lessons is Kevin Baker; the teacher book writer is Timothy Bryan.</p>\n<p><strong>A Fulfilled Covenant</strong><br>\nThe first unit, in four lessons, reveals a new sign of the covenant for Jewish and Gentile believers, as recorded in Matthew, Mark, Luke, Hebrews, and Colossians. During the celebration of the Passover, Jesus explained to the disciples that he would initiate a new covenant through his death. Paul explains that the sign of the covenant is now a relationship of the heart between God and God's people, not circumcision.</p>\n<p><strong>A Heartfelt Covenant</strong><br>\nThe four lessons in this unit give new meaning and purpose to the Law. According to Matthew, Jesus began teaching the Law in a way that gave life to the hearer and the doer. Unlike other teachers of the Law, Jesus preached the transforming righteousness of the Kingdom. Jesus challenged the mere external observance of God's law without internal transformation.</p>\n<p><strong>Covenant: A Personal Perspective</strong><br>\nThe four lessons in this unit focus on personal relationships between people in 1 Samuel, Ruth, and Ephesians. Ultimately, those relationships pave the way for the Messiah. After Christ established the New Testament church, relationships between people have been based on relationship with Christ Jesus. These relationships continue the work of Christ Jesus by spreading the gospel message. </p>\n<p>Developed for use with the student book based on the <em>Uniform Series</em>, this leader resource provides a wealth of information, planning ideas, and lesson guides for each of the 13 lessons in the quarter.

The writer of the student book lessons is Clara Welch; the teacher book writer is Stan Purdum.</p>\n<p><strong>God, the Creator</strong><br>\nThis unit takes us through texts that help us discern what \"Godness\" is. The readings from Genesis present the Lord as the divine initiator of the cosmos and as the creator of humankind. The Exodus text reminds us that God is not limited to what we can know of or imagine about God, and that mystery remains part of God's nature. In Lesson 4, we learn about Wisdom as an essential part of who God is. And Lesson 5, invites us to consider Christ's role with God in the world's creation. These lessons encourage us to develop the spiritual practice of mindfulness.</p>\n<p><strong>In God's Image</strong><br>\nThis unit focuses on the human condition. Lesson 6 recalls the story of the sin of Achan, reminding us of the chasm sin imposes between ourselves and our Creator. Lesson 7 takes us to Psalm 51, which is a prayer that models the nature of penitence that asks God to bridge the breach caused by sin. Lesson 8 lets us hear Jesus talking about being born anew and how that provides entry into the kingdom of God. Lesson 9 takes us to a text in Romans, which enables us to consider what the redeemed life looks like. These lessons help us focus on the spiritual practice of confession.</p>\n<p><strong>Worship</strong><br>\nThis unit unites around the theme \"objects of worship,\" with \"objects\" meaning not worship aids, such as candles and paraments, but those things we place ahead of God. In Lesson 10, we look at the first two of the Ten Commandments. Lesson 11 takes us to the story of the gold calf and gives us a chance to think about why we may deliberately choose to worship that which is not God.

These daily readings, which prepare us for the 13 lessons in Adult Bible Studies, are\nwritten by Sue Mink, Michael Whitcomb-Tavey, and Clara Welch.</p>\n<p><strong>Wilderness</strong><br>\nSuffering is a reality of life, and the readings in this unit take us to places in Scripture where suffering is a dominant theme. From the Old Testament and the New Testament, we read stories that take place in gardens and in the wilderness. We also retrace the exile of the people of Judah and better understand the suffering that experience brought. We examine these stories, not to wallow in misery, but to understand them as a context for hope and salvation as we, too, live through times of suffering.</p>\n<p><strong>Salvation</strong><br>\nSuffering is not the end of our story when God is involved with us. Thus, the readings in this second unit are about salvation. They explore the new start for the people of Judah, represented by the rebuilding of the Temple in Haggai's time and the new start for humankind announced by John the Baptist and accomplished through the death and resurrection of Jesus, new starts made possible by God&rsquo;s initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>Grace</strong><br>\nOne of the early readings in this quarter is about the expulsion from the garden of Eden, the loss of paradise. In the readings from this unit, we see the Bible&rsquo;s prophecy of the return to paradise&mdash;the kingdom of God&mdash;made possible by God&rsquo;s grace, along with other points in Scripture at which God&rsquo;s grace was operative. Each of these readings reminds us that God&rsquo;s grace is an ongoing force in life for those who are faithful to God.</p>\nThis ongoing day-by-day Bible study series is a great companion to Adult Bible Studies but can also be used as a standalone study for anyone wanting daily time with God. It is presented in quarterly segments. Bible-based, Christ-focused, and United Methodist-approved, this resource helps individuals develop the discipline of studying the Bible every day and coordinates with the lesson themes of Adult Bible Studies. Each lesson includes a one-page Bible study for each day of the quarter, along with introductory reflection questions and commentary on the daily Scripture passage, life application, and a concluding prayer.

Hope&ndash;&ndash;the expectation that, regardless of what is happening in the present, God has a good future for us&ndash;&ndash;is an underlying and uniting theme in these lessons. Lesson 1 follows Abraham, who left his homeland and moved to Canaan, trusting that God had something good ahead for him. Lesson 2 recalls how Abraham's trust that God was going to give him a place as an inheritance motivated him to make the move. Lesson 3, based on one of the servant songs from Isaiah, speaks of the hope of a servant who \"will bring justice to the nations\" (Isaiah 42:1). Lesson 4 focuses on the angel's announcement to Joseph that Mary would bear God's Son, declaring that Jesus is the fulfillment of \"God with us.\" Lesson 5 looks at Jesus' final words to his disciples before ascending into heaven, planting in them the hope of the Holy Spirit's coming and the reality of Spirit-filled living.<br>\nSpiritual Practice: Scripture</p>\n<p><strong>Covenants: The Basis for Committed Relationships</strong><br>\nThe four lessons in this unit focus on covenants and the promises they include.

Many times these are dreams that have been impressed on us by God himself. But when will they stop being dreams and turn into reality? When will these dreams be fulfilled? And what do you do in the meantime? Joseph: Waiting on God’s Timing, Living in God’s Plan is a six-session video-based Bible study examining the life of the biblical character of Joseph, the ultimate dreamer, giving you insight into the power of your choices as you wait on God while pursing your dreams. As a teenager, Joseph had big dreams, but events seemed to circumvent those dreams and landed him in slavery in Egypt. Through this experience Joseph learned to trust in God’s plan for his life, remain obedient and make wise choices, even when they resulted in a jail sentence! Ultimately, Joseph realized his dreams and was reunited and reconciled with his family and was able to be used by God to save millions of people from starvation. God has dreams for your life as well. If you wait on God’s perfect timing, make wise and biblical choices, you too, like Joseph, can see your God-given dreams become reality. This fresh look at Joseph helps you discover new insights and provides a powerful witness to God’s timing and plan for you that will leave you feeling challenged, encouraged, and deeply valued.

It proceeded through all of February and continues through March. The eight lessons of the unit invite us to think about what it means to be the people of God and to pursue holy living. The four lessons for March help us examine how God defines holiness, how holiness is nourished, what holiness means in terms of sexual morality, and how we ought to pray. Much of this unit overlaps Lent, which is an especially appropriate time to think about holiness. <br><br><b>Spiritual Practice: Fasting </b><br>Scriptures: Leviticus 19:1-37; 1 Peter 2:1-10; 1 Corinthians 6:12-20; Matthew 6:5-18 <br><br><b>New in Christ </b><br>The theme of this unit draws its direction from the Apostle Paul’s words in 2 Corinthians 5:17, which is used as the key verse for each lesson. In the first lesson, we look at the resurrection of Jesus, which is the basis for our new creation.

Author Jimmy Hamilton, a.k.a. the Street Preacher, writes in the hope that God will raise up an army of street preachers throughout the world and send them into cities, towns, and villages to herald Christ once again. In this way, God will be glorified, Christ lifted up, and the church gathered in from the four corners of the earth.<br />\n<br />\nThis guide for young men hoping to become street preachers seeks to take them with a heaven-sent love to rescue the perishing, care for the dying, and snatch them from sin and the grave.</p>","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/55/9781973681755.jpg","edition":3,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":1190,"date_published":"20191218","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Jimmy Hamilton"],"title":"So You Want to Be a Street Preacher","isbn13":"9781973681755","msrp":"28.95","binding":"ePub","isbn":"1973681757"},{"publisher":"R.H.

Confronted with new emotional and practical challenges when her parents entered a nursing home, she navigated through a maze of medical bills and paperwork, gained valuable insight from visits with doctors and consultations with elder law attorneys, and found love for her parents in new and often surprising places. It was a difficult journey, and a lonely one. In <i>Changing Places</i>, a book based on her popular newspaper column, she shares what she learned along the way.<P>Author Biography&#58; Judy Kramer is a journalist who writes for <i>The Gazette</i>, a greater Washington, D.C. subsidiary of <i>The Washington Post</i>. She has become a de facto public advocate for education about, and improvement of, elder care in this country. She lives in Silver Spring, Maryland.</p> <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> <p>Beginning as a series of newspaper columns recording how she cared for her parents, Kramer's work blossomed into a poignant book that plumbs the depths of love, loss and the ties that bind. At times, traveling with my parents into their old age has felt like a forced march, she observes. Often I have not wanted to go. But it gives me great satisfaction that we have dealt with the roadblocks, followed the detours, found the route, and made the trip together. The core of Kramer's book charts the course of their intertwined lives, from the point she began taking over the caregiver role--managing her parents' finances, driving them to doctors' appointments, helping them move to a nursing home and so on, all while working full-time and caring for her own family--through their deaths within two months of each other and the unexpected difficulties she had navigating the shoals of grief. Along the way, Kramer had to learn everything from what a durable power of attorney is to how to deal with bureaucratic complications, negotiate the vagaries of medicaid, step back when her parents made choices she felt weren't the wisest and find innovative ways to make their lives more comfortable (such as using a music stand to stabilize books that shaky hands could no longer hold). Kramer shares her frustrations and triumphs with candor; her memoir should resonate with anyone facing similar experiences. (Sept.)

A word from a foreign language inserted in a novel for emphasis or scientific and technical terms might be baffling and require a dictionary or Google Search. If you have ever listened to a Sunday morning sermon, heard a reading by a lector, sung a hymn, engaged in a Bible study, or read a passage in the Bible and realized that you don't have a clue what a certain word means, you are not alone. Other times, we carelessly read over a word without comprehending the deeper scriptural meaning because it is familiar; we've seen or heard it many times. Frequently used words such as hope, fear, peace, joy, and, yes, even worship and amen are not fully appreciated or understood in the context of Scripture. God's Word is full of important words; after all, by his grace, a key word, they lead us to faith and salvation. Some have precise definitions, whereas others convey entire rich concepts or ideas, and some can be confusing if not intimidating especially to new Christians. There are words of comfort, action, power, but, best of all, eternal life.<br></p><p>The goal of this book is to assist the person in the pew on Sunday morning, in a Bible class, or engaged in personal study, not only new Christians but also long-time adherents, to better understand and appreciate the words that they hear or read. It can serve as a review for veteran Christians looking to develop a deeper understanding of their faith and a primer for new Christians who are trying to build a foundation for theirs.<br></p>","language":"eng","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/93/19/9781639039319.jpg","title_long":"I'm in This for You The Truth in Becoming a Great Leader","edition":3,"dimensions":"eBook","pages":88,"date_published":"2022-01-12","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Ron Stieglitz"],"title":"Words of the Word","isbn13":"9781639039319","msrp":"73.32","binding":"eBook","isbn":"1639039317"},{"publisher":"Gospel Publishing House","synopsis":"<p>Explore the Scriptures for yourself or with a group using these 52 Bible-based lessons.

While They Prize Committed And Authentic Relationships, They Appear To Be Reluctant Participants. They Prefer To Foster Ambiguity In Their Romantic Relationships, Even As They Value Honesty And Clarity. There Is, At Once, A Valuing Of Long-term As Well As A Decentering Of Romantic Relationships. Although Our Current Understanding Is Incomplete, This Text Grapples With These Perplexing Questions. In Attempting To Understand Emerging Adults And Their Romantic Lives, Researchers Must Consider The Challenging Economic Conditions In Which Today's Emerging Adults Find Themselves. With An Emphasis On Commitment And Sacrifice And Their Centrality To One's Readiness For A Long-term Relationship, This Book Reviews The Main Milestones In Transitioning From An I Identity To A We Identity And Discusses The Concepts Of Choice And Risk. Further, The Book Examines Structures Such As Asymmetrically Committed Relationships, Cohabitation, And Marriage Through The Lens Of Commitment, Risk, And Risk Avoidance. Probing Extensively Into The Romantic Lives Of Emerging Adults -- Their Attitudes, Values And Expectations -- This Text Examines Some Of The Developmental And Contextual Realities Against Which Romantic Attachment Must Be Viewed. Critical Topics Such As Casual And Sexual Experiences And Relationships, Integration Of Work And Love, Breakups, Marriage, Going Solo, And Social Media And Its Influences Are Considered.

Hope&ndash;&ndash;the expectation that, regardless of what is happening in the present, God has a good future for us&ndash;&ndash;is an underlying and uniting theme in these lessons. Lesson 1 follows Abraham, who left his homeland and moved to Canaan, trusting that God had something good ahead for him. Lesson 2 recalls how Abraham's trust that God was going to give him a place as an inheritance motivated him to make the move. Lesson 3, based on one of the servant songs from Isaiah, speaks of the hope of a servant who \"will bring justice to the nations\" (Isaiah 42:1). Lesson 4 focuses on the angel's announcement to Joseph that Mary would bear God's Son, declaring that Jesus is the fulfillment of \"God with us.\" Lesson 5 looks at Jesus' final words to his disciples before ascending into heaven, planting in them the hope of the Holy Spirit's coming and the reality of Spirit-filled living.<br>\nSpiritual Practice: Scripture</p>\n<p><strong>Covenants: The Basis for Committed Relationships</strong><br>\nThe four lessons in this unit focus on covenants and the promises they include.

Jesus tells the disciples in John’s Gospel that he must leave so that the Comforter or Holy Spirit could come. The Spirit will lead and guide us into all truth and bring gifts and graces to all who will receive them. This transforming power prepares us for ministry in the world.<br>The Holy Spirit’s work in empowering us to be the church and carry out its mission is not limited to time and space. The lessons in Unit 2 take us through a series of events in the context of Jewish and Gentile hostility in which we see how the Holy Spirit moved the church forward to serve others.<br>The final<b> </b>four lessons in this quarter explore a problem that has plagued humankind throughout the ages—violence! How do we as the people of God confront and overcome this menace to the faith?<b><br> <br> Unit 1: The Fruit of the Spirit</b><br> Paul used the metaphor of fruit to help us understand that our lives are like the firstfruits of offering. Through participation in Christ’s crucifixion through baptism, we have offered our lives to God’s service. The Holy Spirit then gives us gifts to display.<br> <br>Scriptures: Acts 2:1-4, 17-21, 33, 38-39; 1 Corinthians 2:10-16; Galatians 5:13-21; Galatians 5:22-26<br> Spiritual Practice: Silence<br> <br> <b>Unit 2: The Work of the Church</b><br> These lessons take us through a series of events in the Book of Acts in which the activity of the Holy Spirit drives the action forward.

It is presented in quarterly segments. Bible-based, and Christ-focused, it coordinates with the lesson themes of Adult Bible Studies. Each daily reading includes a one-page Bible study for each day of the quarter, along with introductory reflection questions and commentary on the daily Scripture passage, life application, and a concluding prayer. <br><br><b><i>Daily Bible Study </i></b><b>Winter 2021-2022</b><br> <b>Theme: Engage</b><br>Perhaps at no other time during the year is the call of our faith more at odds with culture than during Advent. The Christian season that calls us to wait is met with a culture that encourages us to decorate, entertain, buy, spend, and entertain, with calendars booked from season’s beginning to its end. Such ceaseless activity can blind us to the awe and wonder of God’s presence all around us, leaving us spiritually parched, empty, and unable to join in the life and work to which God calls us. These Bible lessons call us to wait and to respond with wonder to the God who came to us in Jesus Christ, thus equipping ourselves to bear witness to our faith.<br> <b><br> </b><b>Unit 1: Wait for It</b><br>Advent is a time of anticipation and waiting. This unit invites us to explore waiting as an important element in three episodes in Luke’s telling of the Christmas story. It ends with a reminder that as much as we are called to wait for the Lord, Jesus Christ waits patiently for us.<br>Scriptures: Luke 1:5-25, 57-58; Luke 1:26-38, 57-58; Luke 2:25-38; Revelation 3:20-4:11<br> <br>Spiritual Practice: Praying without ceasing<br> <br><b>Unit 2: Wonder</b><br>We are a busy people rushing from place to place and task to task as the hands of the clock chase each other around the dial. We get caught up in the mundane reality of ordinary life and if we do not stop, we can so easily miss the extraordinary and sublime experience of entering into God’s presence. The lessons in this unit explore various ways human beings have experienced God’s glory.<br> <br>Scriptures: Psalm 19; Isaiah 6:1-13; Mark 9:2-8; Exodus 34:29-35; Revelation 19:1-10<br> <br>Spiritual Practice: Singing/meditating on hymns of praise <br> <br><b>Unit 3: Show and Tell</b><br>The lessons in this unit explore the various ways we can participate with God through our actions. When we read through both the Old and the New Testaments, we see that by engaging in life-giving activities, we join in the work to which God set our hands in the Garden of Eden. God calls us both to show and to tell others of our faith.<br> <br>Scriptures: Deuteronomy 6:4-9, Matthew 22:34-40; Matthew 5:14-16; James 1:19-27; Matthew 28:16-20 <br> <br><br>Spiritual Practice: Testimony in word and deed <br> <br> Visit AdultBibleStudies.com and sign up for the weekly newsletter to automatically receive the FREE Current Events Supplement and other information about these resources and more!","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/61/9781791006761.jpg","edition":1,"pages":616,"date_published":"20211019","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Henry G.

Una mujer pública tiene un objetivo claro, que coincide con la relectura del trabajo de una feminista: iluminar aquellas zonas de su pensamiento y trayectoria que han permanecido ocultas por las fuerzas de una historia escrita predominantemente por hombres, así como documentar histórica y culturalmente las diferentes vías a través de las que cambió el destino de la nación. La figura de Elena Caffarena se recuerda cuando se habla de la consecución del sufragio universal en nuestro país, que este 2019 conmemora 100 años, pero quizás más desconocido es su rol en el MEMCH, Movimiento Pro Emancipación de las Mujeres de Chile, que organizó el malestar de un amplio abanico de mujeres y las impulsó a luchar públicamente por la igualdad de derechos, insistiendo en el derecho al trabajo, a la cultura, y en otras demandas, como el control de la natalidad, el aborto y el divorcio. Su defensa de los derechos de la mujer excedió el activismo y, como abogada y desde las lides del derecho, se aseguró de volver jurisprudencia derechos mínimos para las mujeres, como la posibilidad de recibir una pensión aun cuando hubieran abandonado el hogar conyugal, o tomar decisiones comerciales dentro del matrimonio. Del mismo modo, desde su preocupación por los derechos humanos, durante la dictadura luchó por el restablecimiento de la democracia y la protección de quienes más lo necesitaban. Todas estas dimensiones son abordadas en este libro, que esperamos traiga al presente, y en toda su potencia, la figura de una mujer clave en la historia de nuestro país.","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/89/9789561126589.jpg","edition":1,"pages":288,"date_published":"febrero 2020","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Elena Caffarena"],"title":"Elena Caffarena.

Authentic discipleship involves imitating Jesus, and we must begin with an understanding of Jesus as Messiah and the kingdom to which he invites us to belong. We soon discover as we follow Jesus that his kingdom turns our expectations totally upside down. As we walk with Jesus, we must admit that we sometimes totally miss the mark. Yet Christ forgives us, restores us, and equips us to live into our identities as Christ-followers.<br>As his followers, we have responsibilities and opportunities to help grow the kingdom. One way is through stewardship, a concept that is much broader than we may think. Our role involves using not only our physical resources but indeed our very lives as grace-filled cohabitants in God’s marvelous creation.<br><br><b>Unit 1: The Mark You Make</b><br> Discipleship in Mark’s Gospel is often described as the way of the cross because of the repeated emphasis upon following Jesus on the way to Jerusalem and the command to take up one’s cross and follow Jesus (Mark 8:34). In this season when we commemorate Jesus’ journey to Jerusalem, we give our attention to various aspects of discipleship we find in Mark’s Gospel.<br>Scriptures: Mark 8:27-38; Mark 9:38-50; Mark 10:35-45; Mark 11:12-14, 20-25; Mark 13:5-8, 28-37; Mark 14: 27-42; Mark 16:1-8<br> Spiritual Practice: Reflection and self-examination<br> <br> <b>Unit 2: The Steps You Take</b><br> Creation care has become a prominent topic of discussion in Christian congregations and seminaries during the last couple of decades. While disagreement exists about human responsibility for climate change and to what extent we should limit human activity for the purpose of preservation of endangered species and habitats, Scripture makes clear that God takes pleasure in creation and that our role as stewards requires that we appreciate creation and take our responsibility as stewards seriously.<br>Scriptures: Psalm 104; Leviticus 25:1-13; Deuteronomy 14:22-29; Job 38:4-11; Joel 2:18-26; Romans 8:19-22; 2 Corinthians 9<br> Spiritual Practice: Nurture and care of all creation<br><br><i>Adult Bible Studies</i> components include:<br>Student Book<br>Published quarterly, each week's Student Book lesson lists background Scripture, features key verses, provides reliable and relevant biblical explanation and application, and more, in a readable font size that is accessible to everyone.<br><br>Teacher Book/Commentary Kit<br>Each quarterly Teacher/Commentary Kit includes a Teacher Book with additional biblical background and exposition and suggestions for guiding group discussion and a copy of the new quarterly <i>Adult Bible Studies</i> Concise Commentary, designed for readers who seek additional background on the biblical text for each session of <i>Adult Bible Studies</i>.<br><br>Video-DVD<br>Does your group enjoy watching videos to generate conversation around Bible studies?

The lessons move through various responses people of faith are called to make as they live out their faith in both good times and difficult ones. <br> <br><b>Unit 1: Intended for Good</b><br>The Genesis story of Joseph and his brothers is one of the great stories from the Bible, with forgiveness and grace among its underlying themes. As the story stretches over several chapters of Genesis, the four weeks of this unit give us ample time to explore it and see how the meaning of its events changed as Joseph recognized God at work behind the scenes.<br> <br><b>Scriptures: </b>Genesis 37:5-28; Genesis 39:1-21; Genesis 41:1-16, 25-32; Genesis 45:1-15<b></b><br> <br><b>Spiritual Practice:</b> Forgiveness<br> <br><b>Unit 2: The People Next Door</b><br>“Neighbor” is an important theme in both the Old and New Testaments, and so this four-lesson unit delves into it from several perspectives. The first lesson (Lesson 5 in this quarter) gathers various verses from Proverbs on that topic. The second lesson, using a passage from the book of Ruth, invites us to think about what it means to be a neighbor to immigrants. The third lesson looks in the book of Acts for how the early church leaders incorporated neighborliness into the church’s structure. And the fourth lesson takes us to Mark’s Gospel for an example of four individuals who were true neighbors to a man in need.<br> <br><b>Scriptures: </b>Proverbs 3:27-30; 6:1-5; 25:20-23; Ruth 2:4-16; Acts 6:1-7; Mark 2:1-12<b></b><br><b> </b><br><b>Spiritual Practice: </b>Scripture<br> <br><b>Unit 3: The Five Stages of Job</b><br>As suffering in some form comes to most of us at some point (or points) in life, it is useful to consider how Job, who suffered greatly, responded to it, and to learn from his experience.

Given the fallen nature of the human heart as well as the complexities of personalities, conflict is an inevitable aspect of ministry. How do women deal with emotions when other women are insensitive, manipulative, or just plain mean? What does the Bible tell us? To be equpped for conflict, women must understand and master strategies specifically related to conflict with other women. Leading Women Who Wound shows women how to effectively deal with conflict within their ministries. Seasoned women's ministry leaders themselves, Sue Edwards and Kelley Mathews walk through several different aspects of conflict resolution including self examination, identification of potential sources of conflict, tools for conflict resolution, and insight on how to prevent and move beyond conflict to minister to those who have been sources of contention. Recognizing that not all conflict results in a happy ending, Leading Women Who Wound gives the tools necessary to minister effectively and move forward with integrity.","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/96/9781575673196.jpg","title_long":"Leading Women Who Wound","edition":1,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":394,"date_published":"20090201","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Sue Edwards"],"title":"Leading Women Who Wound","isbn13":"9781575673196","msrp":"19.95","binding":"ePub","related":{"Kindle Edition":"0802481531","Paperback":"0802481531"},"isbn":"1575673193"},{"publisher":"R.H.

Much of what Jesus has to say is uplifting or inspiring. But let&rsquo;s face it: Sometimes Jesus says things that are confusing, perplexing, or even offensive.

In each chapter, he examines a different statement or brief teaching from Jesus, using the provided biblical and other background to help illuminate the passage in question. Davis not only guides you to understand the passage, but shows you what it means to take it to heart and embrace a new way of life as a result. Starting with a passage we struggle with, Davis opens it to reveal a challenging, hopeful word that will bring the gospel&rsquo;s transformative power into your life.<br>\n<br>\nDiscussion questions at the end of each chapter are designed to help leaders of small groups.

Activate Your Faith is an imperative to inspire Christians to tap into the great abundance of divine and physical resources available to them as members of the community of faith. Jesus’ prayer in John 17 reveals the magnitude of the protection and power believers have because they walk with Jesus. Brown argues quite convincingly that this divine protection and power envelops Christians and is applicable to every aspect of their lives. God’s favor pervades their entire existence, and nothing can delay or prohibit its positive effects.

Today’s culture often defines ‘bridge building’ and reconciliation as a one-way street that leads to full theological, political and social agreement. Yet Christ demonstrated a different path of religious and cultural engagement to establish his kingdom here on earth. In light of such countercultural principles, the Christian community needs a new view on the issues that divide conservative believers and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities. Andrew Marin uses practical applications he’s learned over the last decade of living and working in the LGBT neighborhood of Chicago (Boystown), as well as his international speaking and consulting ministry, to offer a variety of practical teaching, insights, and life-lessons on reaching the LGBT community. Rather than avoiding the topic of homosexuality, Love Is an Orientation aims to equip the Christian community to bridge the gap between LGBT and religious communities. Instead of discussing how to “fix” gay people, this small group Bible study is all about getting to know them, engage them, and love them like Jesus does. After this study, you, your small group and your church will know what it means to peacefully and productively build bridges with the LGBT community. This Participant Guide is filled with insights, questions for discussion, and applications that will equip you with tools to reach out to the LGBT community in love and understanding. Sessions include: Love Is Our Orientation Building Bridges Theology of Bridge Builders Answering Tough Questions Adolescents and Sexuality Living in the Tension Designed for use with the Love Is an Orientation Video Study (sold separately). ","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/32/9780310692232.jpg","title_long":"Love-is-an-orientation-participant-s-guide-practical-ways-to-build-bridges-with-the-gay-community","edition":10,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":1152,"date_published":"20130529","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Andrew Marin; Ginny Olson"],"title":"Love Is an Orientation Participant's Guide","isbn13":"9780310692232","msrp":"16.99","binding":"ePub","related":{"Paperback":"0310891272"},"isbn":"0310692237"},{"publisher":"Author Solutions","synopsis":"<p>Called to Ministry, Now What! has been written for those contemplating venturing into ministry as well as those already in ministry but who have no clue where to start or how to develop their calling.

This unit of lessons looks at the various ways that the Bible makes clear how we belong to God’s people even when we appear to be outsiders. Several of the lessons point out where we as human beings insert distinctions that restrict membership within the community of Christ.<br><b>Scriptures: </b>Jeremiah 29:1-23; Luke 7:36-50; Galatians 2:11-21; Philippians 3:2-21; Ephesians 2:19-21<br><b>Spiritual Practice:</b> Hospitality<br><b><br></b><b>Unit 2: Into the Future </b><br>After over 2000 years of existence as an institution, we can easily take for granted that we know what the church is. This unit invites readers to look at it from the view of the community living into the future. The Greek word for church, e<i>kklesia</i>, is not a word that the first members of the church associated with a religious activity. The word signifies the assembly of the people of God. It is instructive to look at what their understanding of the purpose of assembling as a group signified, how it has shaped our understanding of church, and how reading these texts might renew and expand our understanding.<br><b>Scriptures: </b>Acts 2:37-47;1 Corinthians 12:12-31; Matthew 16:13-19; Revelation 3:1-6, 14-20; Deuteronomy 29:10-29<br><b>Spiritual Practice: Community</b><br><b><br></b><b>Unit 3: The Fellowship of the Table</b><br>Once one enters the Church through baptism, the central identity marker for membership in the church is participation in Communion. The opening of God’s people to both Jews and Greeks, men and women, masters and slaves required people previously unaccustomed to eating together to sit down at a common table. When we look at the Gospel narratives, we see Jesus modeling open table fellowship. In this unit, we will look at the significance of the practice of open table fellowship in the church as a sign of God’s shared abundance, ministry of reconciliation, and celebration.<br><b>Scriptures: </b>John 6:1-15; 1 Samuel 25:2-39; 1 Corinthians 11:17-34; Isaiah 25:6-10a; 55:1-3<br><b>Spiritual Practice: </b>Open Table Fellowship<br><br>Adult Bible Study components include:<br>Student Book<br> Published quarterly, each week's Student Book lesson lists background Scripture, features key verses, provides reliable and relevant biblical explanation and application, and more, in a readable font size that is accessible to everyone.<br><br>Teacher Book/Commentary Kit<br>Each quarterly Teacher/Commentary Kit includes a Teacher Book with additional biblical background and exposition and suggestions for guiding group discussion and a copy of the new quarterly Adult Bible Studies Concise Commentary, designed for readers who seek additional background on the biblical text for each session of Adult Bible Studies<br><br>Video-DVD <br>Does your group enjoy watching videos to generate conversation around Bible studies?

Such ceaseless activity can blind us to the awe and wonder of God’s presence all around us, leaving us spiritually parched, empty, and unable to join in the life and work to which God calls us.

It is presented in quarterly segments. Bible-based, and Christ-focused, it coordinates with the lesson themes of Adult Bible Studies. Each daily reading includes a one-page Bible study for each day of the quarter, along with introductory reflection questions and commentary on the daily Scripture passage, life application, and a concluding prayer.<br><br><b><i>Daily Bible Study</i> Spring 2022<br>Theme: Follow</b><br>The lessons this quarter are confined to two units so that we can observe the season of Lent. Authentic discipleship involves imitating Jesus, and we must begin with an understanding of Jesus as Messiah and the kingdom to which he invites us to belong. We soon discover as we follow Jesus that his kingdom turns our expectations totally upside down. As we walk with Jesus, we must admit that we sometimes totally miss the mark. Yet Christ forgives us, restores us, and equips us to live into our identities as Christ-followers.<br>As his followers, we have responsibilities and opportunities to help grow the kingdom. One way is through stewardship, a concept that is much broader than we may think. Our role involves using not only our physical resources but indeed our very lives as grace-filled cohabitants in God’s marvelous creation.<br><br><b>Unit 1: The Mark You Make</b><br>Discipleship in Mark’s Gospel is often described as the way of the cross because of the repeated emphasis upon following Jesus on the way to Jerusalem and the command to take up one’s cross and follow Jesus (Mark 8:34). In this season when we commemorate Jesus’ journey to Jerusalem, we give our attention to various aspects of discipleship we find in Mark’s Gospel.<br><br>Scriptures: Mark 8:27-38; Mark 9:38-50; Mark 10:35-45; Mark 11:12-14, 20-25; Mark 13:5-8, 28-37; Mark 14: 27-42; Mark 16:1-8<br><br>Spiritual Practice: Reflection and self-examination<br><br><b>Unit 2: The Steps You Take</b><br>Creation care has become a prominent topic of discussion in Christian congregations and seminaries during the last couple of decades. While disagreement exists about human responsibility for climate change and to what extent we should limit human activity for the purpose of preservation of endangered species and habitats, Scripture makes clear that God takes pleasure in creation and that our role as stewards requires that we appreciate creation and take our responsibility as stewards seriously.<br><br>Scriptures: Psalm 104; Leviticus 25:1-13; Deuteronomy 14:22-29; Job 38:4-11; Joel 2:18-26; Romans 8:19-22; 2 Corinthians 9<br><br>Spiritual Practice: Nurture and care of all creation<br><br><br>","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/92/9781791006792.jpg","edition":2,"pages":360,"date_published":"20220118","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Clara K.

Jesus tells the disciples in John’s Gospel that he must leave so that the Comforter or Holy Spirit could come. The Spirit will lead and guide us into all truth and bring gifts and graces to all who will receive them. This transforming power prepares us for ministry in the world.<br>The Holy Spirit’s work in empowering us to be the church and carry out its mission is not limited to time and space. The lessons in Unit 2 take us through a series of events in the context of Jewish and Gentile hostility in which we see how the Holy Spirit moved the church forward to serve others.<br>The final<b> </b>four lessons in this quarter explore a problem that has plagued humankind throughout the ages—violence! How do we as the people of God confront and overcome this menace to the faith?<b><br> <br> Unit 1: The Fruit of the Spirit</b><br> Paul used the metaphor of fruit to help us understand that our lives are like the firstfruits of offering. Through participation in Christ’s crucifixion through baptism, we have offered our lives to God’s service. The Holy Spirit then gives us gifts to display.<br>Scriptures: Acts 2:1-4, 17-21, 33, 38-39; 1 Corinthians 2:10-16; Galatians 5:13-21; Galatians 5:22-26<br> Spiritual Practice: Silence<br> <br> <b>Unit 2: The Work of the Church</b><br> These lessons take us through a series of events in the Book of Acts in which the activity of the Holy Spirit drives the action forward. The lessons in Unit 1 identify the gifts granted to us by the Spirit; these lessons look at the path on which the Spirit directs our lives and how the Spirit is already active before we arrive at our destination.<br>Scriptures: Acts 4:23-31; Acts 8:26-39; Acts 11:1-18; Acts 15:1-21; Acts 16:25-34<br>Spiritual Practice: Service<br><br><b>Unit 3: The Pursuit of the People</b><br>God’s word established a created order that depends on fruitfulness and cultivation rather than violence to maintain it, but humanity through its rivalries brings violence into God’s created order. It is clear from Scripture that God’s intent is to reestablish <i>shalom</i>, the Hebrew word that means “a shared well-being and abundance.” While violence remains a part of the created order, God does not quietly sanction the human use of violence and calls us to imitate God’s love and work toward <i>shalom</i>.<br>Scriptures: 1 Chronicles 22:6-10, 17-19; Matthew 5:9, 38-48; Ephesians 2:11-22; Matthew 26:47-56<br>Spiritual Practice: Remembering <br><i>Adult Bible Studies</i> components include:<br> Student Book<br> Published quarterly, each week's Student Book lesson lists background Scripture, features key verses, provides reliable and relevant biblical explanation and application, and more, in a readable font size that is accessible to everyone.<br> <br> Teacher Book/Commentary Kit<br> Each quarterly Teacher/Commentary Kit includes a Teacher Book with additional biblical background and exposition and suggestions for guiding group discussion and a copy of the new quarterly <i>Adult Bible Studies</i> Concise Commentary, designed for readers who seek additional background on the biblical text for each session of <i>Adult Bible Studies</i>.<br> <br> Video-DVD<br> Does your group enjoy watching videos to generate conversation around Bible studies?

Drawing upon conversations with retired professionals from around the country, it identifies some of the key transitions in the first years of retirement, the unique opportunities for personal growth in this phase of life, and the real challenges we must face. Retired engineer Jack Hansen and spiritual formation leader Jerry Haas explore the transitions, opportunities, and challenges of facing retirement through a series of interviews with persons facing and in retirement. It is about the more personal dimensions of the transition from working full time to retirement, including relationships, feelings of self-worth and purpose, and spiritual and intellectual growth.</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole, the conversations and interactions with retirees suggest an exciting and challenging picture of retirement. This time of life can be one of significant personal growth. It can also be an opportunity for further contribution to one's professional field or the investment of one's talents and experience in volunteer capacities. It is also clear that moving from full-time work to retirement involves important and sometimes painful adjustments in key relationships and in sources of self worth. With some attention and effort, however, these are usually worked through successfully in early retirement years.</p>","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/70/9780835812870.jpg","edition":1,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":270,"date_published":"20100701","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["R.

Where do we find\ninstances of hypocrisy or holiness? And how do these tendencies\ncontribute to or diminish our hope? Lesson 5 focuses on John the\nBaptist, preparing the way for Jesus, the hope of the<br>\nworld. Lesson 6\ntells of Jesus commenting on John&rsquo;s ministry and announcing the good\nnews. Lessons 7 and 8 help us think about how the hope Jesus brought\nfunctions in our lives.

The eight lessons of the unit invite us\nto think about what it means to be the people of God and to pursue holy\nliving. The four lessons in this quarter help us look at how we deal\nwith one another; how faith is expressed action; the sort of &ldquo;fasting&rdquo;\nGod wants from us (whether or not we abstain from certain foods); and\nhow, in fact, Christians are the temple of God.

Bible-based, Christ-focused, and United Methodist-approved, this resource helps individuals develop the discipline of studying the Bible every day. It coordinates with the lesson themes of Adult Bible Studies listed on the facing page. Each lesson includes: a one-page Bible study for each day of the quarter, along with introductory reflection questions and Commentary on the daily Scripture passage, Life Application, and a concluding prayer group study. <br>Summer theme:<br> RESPOND<br>The three units of Bible lessons in this quarter unify around the theme, Respond. The lessons move through various responses people of faith are called to make as they live out their faith in both good times and difficult ones.<br> <br> <b>Unit 1: Intended for Good</b><br> The Genesis story of Joseph and his brothers is one of the great stories from the Bible, with forgiveness and grace among its underlying themes. As the story stretches over several chapters of Genesis, the four weeks of this unit give us ample time to explore it and see how the meaning of its events changed as Joseph recognized God at work behind the scenes.<br> <br> <b>Scriptures: </b>Genesis 37:5-28; Genesis 39:1-21; Genesis 41:1-16, 25-32; Genesis 45:1-15<br> <br> <b>Spiritual Practice:</b> Forgiveness<br> <br> <b>Unit 2: The People Next Door</b><br> “Neighbor” is an important theme in both the Old and New Testaments, and so this four-lesson unit delves into it from several perspectives. The first lesson (Lesson 5 in this quarter) gathers various verses from Proverbs on that topic. The second lesson, using a passage from the book of Ruth, invites us to think about what it means to be a neighbor to immigrants. The third lesson looks in the book of Acts for how the early church leaders incorporated neighborliness into the church’s structure. And the fourth lesson takes us to Mark’s Gospel for an example of four individuals who were true neighbors to a man in need.<br> <br> <b>Scriptures: </b>Proverbs 3:27-30; 6:1-5; 25:20-23; Ruth 2:4-16; Acts 6:1-7; Mark 2:1-12<br> <br> <b>Spiritual Practice: </b>Scripture<br> <br> <b>Unit 3: The Five Stages of Job</b><br> As suffering in some form comes to most of us at some point (or points) in life, it is useful to consider how Job, who suffered greatly, responded to it, and to learn from his experience. The five lessons of this unit show us five diverse ways Job responded to his calamities: worship, resignation, protest, angry despair, and acceptance. While not suggesting that all of these are useful in every case, the lessons help us recognize what may be going on in our spirits when suffering overtakes us.<br> <br> <b>Scriptures: </b>Job 1:8-20; Job 1:21-22, 2:7-10; Job 19:1-6, 13-19; Job 30:16-23; Job 40:1-5; 41:1-10; 42:1-6<br> <br> <b>Spiritual Practice:</b> Lament","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/94/9781501895494.jpg","edition":4,"pages":508,"date_published":"20210420","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Taylor W.

Confronted with\nthis complicated task and the many dilemmas that came with it, Nehemiah\nchose not to dwell on his problems or to pursue his own answers.\nInstead, he sought God&rsquo;s solutions, following God&rsquo;s lead and trusting\nGod&rsquo;s purposes. God&rsquo;s people today are called to do the same. In each\nchapter, Talbot Davis shows how Nehemiah&rsquo;s experiences mirror the\nproblems we face, as individuals and as a society. As you read this\nbook, you will hear God&rsquo;s call to be someone who finds solutions. You\nwill see how you can follow in Nehemiah&rsquo;s footsteps, building up your\nlife and the world around you. You will be challenged not to focus on\nproblems, but to seek God&rsquo;s solutions and how you can help bring them\nabout. <br>\n<br>\nThis book is based on a sermon series Talbot Davis\ndelivered at Good Shepherd United Methodist Church. Each chapter\nincludes questions for reflection and discussion, a practical focus for\nthe week, a closing prayer, and daily scripture passages to guide\npersonal reading throughout the week. <br>\n<br>","language":"en","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/99/9781501816499.jpg","title_long":"Solve: Finding God's Solutions in a World of Problems","edition":1,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":86,"date_published":"2016","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Davis, Talbot"],"title":"Solve: Finding God's Solutions in a World of Problems","isbn13":"9781501816499","msrp":"9.99","binding":"Kindle Edition","related":{"Paperback":"1501816489"},"isbn":"1501816497"},{"publisher":"R.H.

God is actually fleshed among us in Jesus, poured out on us in the Holy Spirit’s intoxication of the church. God is three divine persons in perfect harmony and beauty—and God invites us into that unimaginable intimacy. We don’t know this God, but we should. <br><br><i>Trinity</i> uses scripture, the Early Church tradition, and some modern theology to argue that God is a mystery whom we can’t understand but who can shape our misunderstanding to allow for faithful living and holy love of God and neighbor.<br>“Jason<br>Byassee thinks like a theologian, writes like a journalist, and<br>communicates like a storyteller. We live in a time of trinitarian<br>dissonance, when the central doctrine of the Christian faith is<br>strangely neglected by most Christians. Byassee’s wonderful exploration<br>of the Trinity offers a remedy for that by providing a meat-and-potatoes<br>introduction to the God who is at once Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. An<br>excellent spiritual guide for both mature Christians and those brand<br>new to the Christian faith.” —Rev. Dr. Andrew C.

It is rare these days to find a work<br>of theology that stirs the intellect, the heart, and the spirit.

As people of faith, we believe that our gracious God created all there is, but does that also mean that God also created evil? How does creation jive with what scientists are telling us about the origin of the universe? What does the doctrine of creation tell us about what we call \"the creation,\" that is, the world, its value, purpose, etc? How does understanding the world as God&rsquo;s creation teach us about our role in creation care?</p><p>The Bible tells us that God created the heavens and earth, but does that deny the science of the Big Bang?&nbsp; What does believing that God is the Creator say about how God loves, redeems, and sustains us today or does creation say something only about the past? What about the \"new creation''? Does this have anything to do with the old creation? Does it mean simply that God is so tired of the rebelliousness of creation that it seems best to erase the present one and start anew? Or is there a connection between the two?</p><p>What does the doctrine of creation say about us? Aren&rsquo;t we created in God&rsquo;s image and aren&rsquo;t we part of the good creation of a loving God?&nbsp; If so, why is there evil and rebelliousness in us? Where does our ill-will, our desire to do evil, come from? Is there freedom of the will or are all things preordained by God? Just how detailed is God&rsquo;s plan for us?</p><p>While no one author can deal with all these questions, this book will help us begin the conversation and gain new understanding of how the doctrine of creation can help us address these very human and timeless questions.</p><p>Series Description:</p><p>Belief Matters: How to Love God with Your Mind is a series of books written by widely recognized authors who will help readers think more clearly about their faith and better understand their beliefs, so that they can live more faithfully. These books will also help readers become aware of thoughtful resources and conceptual frames of reference that not only will deepen their faith, but also help them better understand what we say and do in Church. Conversational in tone, these books are reflections on major theological topics and are suitable for a 4-session individual or group study. The intent of the series is to help readers feel as though they are sitting, having coffee as authors share their &ldquo;take&rdquo; and show that by thinking more clearly about the faith, persons can love God more fully, live with confidence, and change the world.</p>","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/64/9781501805264.jpg","edition":5,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":1091,"date_published":"20151103","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Dr. Justo L.

What unravels for Tracy D. Sharpley-Whiting is a new, and problematic, politics of gender. In this fascinating and forceful book, Sharpley-Whiting, a feminist writer who is a member of the hip hop generation, interrogates the complexities of young black women's engagement with a culture that is masculinist, misogynistic, and frequently mystifying.</p>\n<p>Beyond their portrayal in rap lyrics, the display of black women in music videos, television, film, fashion, and on the Internet is indispensable to the mass media engineered appeal of hip hop culture, the author argues. And the commercial trafficking in the images and behaviors associated with hip hop has made them appear normal, acceptable, and entertaining - both in the U.S. and around the world.</p>\n<p>Sharpley-Whiting questions the impacts of hip hop's increasing alliance with the sex industry, the rise of groupie culture in the hip hop world, the impact of hip hop's compulsory heterosexual culture on young black women, and the permeation of the hip hop ethos into young black women's conceptions of love and romance.</p>\n<p>The author knows her subject from the inside. Coming of age in the midst of hip hop's evolution in the late 1980s, she mixed her graduate studies with work as a runway and print model in the 1990s. Her book features interviews with exotic dancers, black hip hop groupies, and hip hop generation members Jacklyn “Diva” Bush, rapper Trina, and filmmaker Aishah Simmons, along with the voices of many “everyday” young women.</p>\n<p><b>Pimps Up, Ho’s Down</b> turns down the volume and amplifies the substance of discussions about hip hop culture and to provide a space for young black women to be heard.</p>","language":"en","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/49/9780814740149.jpg","title_long":"Pimps Up, Ho's Down: Hip Hop's Hold on Young Black Women","edition":"1st Edition","dimensions":"Height: 8.50392 Inches, Length: 5.5118 Inches, Width: 0.6251956 Inches","pages":200,"date_published":"2007","subjects":["African American women--Social conditions","Young women--Social conditions","Young women--United States--Social conditions","Hip-hop--Social aspects","Hip-hop--Social aspects--United States","Sex role--Political aspects","Sex role--Political aspects--United States","Sexism","Sexism--United States","African American women--Psychology","Young women--Psychology","Young women--United States--Psychology","African American women","African American women--Interviews","Young women","Young women--United States--Interviews","Social conditions","E185.86 .S515 2007","305.48/896073"],"authors":["Sharpley-Whiting, T.

Literacy has enormous emotional and political associations, and the job of literacy educator often concerns changing attitudes and challenging prejudices - whether in the form of publicity strategies, counselling new students, or in curriculum design. In short, adult literacy education means not only teaching courses like 'fresh start', 'basic skills', 'study skills', 'communication skills', 'language support' and 'return to study', but also designing strategies to encourage people to see that these courses may meet their own interests - and educating them and others to rethink their own negative attitudes to 'illiteracy'.<br>The book looks in detail in at five principles put forward by Jane Mace as central to the education of people who often can read, but wish they could read better; who, technically can write, but have a desire to do so with more expression and coherence. These principles focus on five themes&#58; context, inquiy, authorship, equality and community. Since it is all too easy for literacy education involving adults who do not have formal qualifications to stop short of teaching techniques for 'correct' writing, these principles mean taking seriously a view that adult students are writers as well as readers - that they have an entitlement to be read, as well as to read others.</p>","language":"en","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/46/9780415080446.jpg","title_long":"Talking About Literacy: Principles And Practice Of Adult Literacy Education","edition":"1","dimensions":"5.50 (w) x 8.50 (h) x 0.44 (d)","pages":190,"date_published":"1992","subjects":["Functional Literacy","Reading (adult Education)"],"authors":["Jane Mace"],"title":"Talking About Literacy: Principles And Practice Of Adult Literacy Education","isbn13":"9780415080446","msrp":"215","binding":"Hardcover","isbn":"0415080444"},{"publisher":"R.H.

Conclusions: Abpm (24-hour, Daytime, Or Nighttime) Is A Better Predictor Of Long-term Cv Outcomes Than Obpm (usually Manual Sphygmomanometry) And Should Be Considered The Reference Standard For Evaluating Noninvasive Bp Measurements. A Small Body Of Evidence Suggests, But Does Not Confirm, That Hbpm Can Serve As A Similar Predictor Of Outcomes. Initial Screening By Office-based Methods (manual Sphygmomanometry Or Automated Oscillometric Devices) Variably Predicts Hypertension As Defined By Abpm, Resulting In A Significant Population With Isolated Clinic Hypertension. Limited Evidence Suggests That Patients With Isolated Clinic Hypertension Have Outcomes That Are More Similar To Normotensive Than Hypertensive Persons. Failure To Confirm Initial Elevated Obpm Results May Result In Misdiagnosis And Overtreatment. Limited Evidence Suggests That Repeated Measurements And Improved Procedural Control (e.g., By Automation) May Improve The Diagnostic Accuracy Of Obpm When Used To Screen For High Bp Or Confirm A Diagnosis Of Hypertension. Studies Of Rescreening Intervals At Up To 6 Years Found A Higher Incidence Of Hypertension Overall And At Shorter Intervals For Persons With Bp In The High-normal Range, Older Adults, Persons With An Above Normal Bmi, And African Americans. These Studies Showed Much Lower Incidence At Longer Rescreening Intervals Up To 6 Years In Persons Without These Risk Factors.

The writer of the student book lessons is Clara Welch; the teacher book writer is Stan Purdum.</p>\n<p><strong>God, the Creator</strong><br>\nThis unit takes us through texts that help us discern what \"Godness\" is. The readings from Genesis present the Lord as the divine initiator of the cosmos and as the creator of humankind. The Exodus text reminds us that God is not limited to what we can know of or imagine about God, and that mystery remains part of God's nature. In Lesson 4, we learn about Wisdom as an essential part of who God is. And Lesson 5, invites us to consider Christ's role with God in the world's creation. These lessons encourage us to develop the spiritual practice of mindfulness.</p>\n<p><strong>In God's Image</strong><br>\nThis unit focuses on the human condition. Lesson 6 recalls the story of the sin of Achan, reminding us of the chasm sin imposes between ourselves and our Creator. Lesson 7 takes us to Psalm 51, which is a prayer that models the nature of penitence that asks God to bridge the breach caused by sin. Lesson 8 lets us hear Jesus talking about being born anew and how that provides entry into the kingdom of God. Lesson 9 takes us to a text in Romans, which enables us to consider what the redeemed life looks like. These lessons help us focus on the spiritual practice of confession.</p>\n<p><strong>Worship</strong><br>\nThis unit unites around the theme \"objects of worship,\" with \"objects\" meaning not worship aids, such as candles and paraments, but those things we place ahead of God. In Lesson 10, we look at the first two of the Ten Commandments. Lesson 11 takes us to the story of the gold calf and gives us a chance to think about why we may deliberately choose to worship that which is not God. Lesson 12 reminds us that nothing we worship other than God can impart life. And Lesson 13 invites us to understand that the worship impulse is only satisfied when it is directed toward God. These lessons lead us deeper into the spiritual practice of worship.</p>\nBoth supplementary and complementary to the Adult Bible Studies student book, the teacher book provides small-group leaders, teachers, and facilitators with additional biblical background and exposition and suggestions for guiding group discussion.

We move from the conversion of Paul to a number of Paul's writings, where he speaks out of his thoughtful understanding of salvation through Christ and out of his personal experience of receiving Christ. We are challenged to consider our own salvation and how we can live faithfully into it.<br>\nSpiritual Practice - Mindfulness, Listening, Silence</p>\n<p><strong>Remember Who You Are</strong><br>\nThe lessons in this unit call us to consider who we are as children of God and followers of Christ. At the heart of who we are lies the important concept of covenant. The covenant that God made with Israel is a defining theological affirmation of the Old Testament. The covenant that God made with the church through Christ's blood is a defining theological affirmation of the New Testament. These lessons help us look more closely at those critical covenants and how they inform our thoughts, actions, and relationships.<br>\nSpiritual Practice - Confession</p>\n<p><strong>In This Place</strong><br>\nThe daily readings in this unit call us to think more deeply and specifically about worship by looking at places where, in the Scriptures, worship takes place.

The lessons move through various responses people of faith are called to make as they live out their faith in both good times and difficult ones. <br> <br><b>Unit 1: Intended for Good</b><br>The Genesis story of Joseph and his brothers is one of the great stories from the Bible, with forgiveness and grace among its underlying themes. As the story stretches over several chapters of Genesis, the four weeks of this unit give us ample time to explore it and see how the meaning of its events changed as Joseph recognized God at work behind the scenes.<br> <br><b>Scriptures: </b>Genesis 37:5-28; Genesis 39:1-21; Genesis 41:1-16, 25-32; Genesis 45:1-15<b></b><br> <br><b>Spiritual Practice:</b> Forgiveness<br> <br><b>Unit 2: The People Next Door</b><br>“Neighbor” is an important theme in both the Old and New Testaments, and so this four-lesson unit delves into it from several perspectives. The first lesson (Lesson 5 in this quarter) gathers various verses from Proverbs on that topic. The second lesson, using a passage from the book of Ruth, invites us to think about what it means to be a neighbor to immigrants. The third lesson looks in the book of Acts for how the early church leaders incorporated neighborliness into the church’s structure. And the fourth lesson takes us to Mark’s Gospel for an example of four individuals who were true neighbors to a man in need.<br> <br><b>Scriptures: </b>Proverbs 3:27-30; 6:1-5; 25:20-23; Ruth 2:4-16; Acts 6:1-7; Mark 2:1-12<b></b><br><b> </b><br><b>Spiritual Practice: </b>Scripture<br> <br><b>Unit 3: The Five Stages of Job</b><br>As suffering in some form comes to most of us at some point (or points) in life, it is useful to consider how Job, who suffered greatly, responded to it, and to learn from his experience. The five lessons of this unit show us five diverse ways Job responded to his calamities: worship, resignation, protest, angry despair, and acceptance. While not suggesting that all of these are useful in every case, the lessons help us recognize what may be going on in our spirits when suffering overtakes us.<br> <br><b>Scriptures: </b>Job 1:8-20; Job 1:21-22, 2:7-10; Job 19:1-6, 13-19; Job 30:16-23; Job 40:1-5; 41:1-10; 42:1-6<br><b> </b><br><b>Spiritual Practice:</b> Lament","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/40/9781501895340.jpg","edition":1,"pages":1216,"date_published":"20210420","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Rosanne Osborne"],"title":"Adult Bible Studies Summer 2021 Student","isbn13":"9781501895340","msrp":"13.49","binding":"ePub","isbn":"1501895346"},{"publisher":"Cokesbury","synopsis":"<p><strong>Fall Theme:<br>\nEncounter</strong><br>\nThis fall, our lessons support the theme of \"Encounter.\" The writer of the student book lessons is Chuck Aaron; the teacher book writer is David Mosser.</p>\n<p><strong>So That You Can See</strong><br>\nThe lessons in this unit help us focus on salvation and what it means through example and explanation. We move from the conversion of Paul to a number of Paul's writings, where he speaks out of his thoughtful understanding of salvation through Christ and out of his personal experience of receiving Christ. We are challenged to consider our own salvation and how we can live faithfully into it.<br>\nSpiritual Practice - Mindfulness, Listening, Silence</p>\n<p><strong>Remember Who You Are</strong><br>\nThe lessons in this unit call us to consider who we are as children of God and followers of Christ. At the heart of who we are lies the important concept of covenant. The covenant that God made with Israel is a defining theological affirmation of the Old Testament. The covenant that God made with the church through Christ's blood is a defining theological affirmation of the New Testament. These lessons help us look more closely at those critical covenants and how they inform our thoughts, actions, and relationships.<br>\nSpiritual Practice - Confession</p>\n<p><strong>In This Place</strong><br>\nThe daily readings in this unit call us to think more deeply and specifically about worship by looking at places where, in the Scriptures, worship takes place. We will look at ad hoc altars, synagogues, the church, and worship at the throne of God. In each case, we will be challenged to evaluate our worship and broaden our understanding of where and how worship can happen.<br>\nSpiritual Practice -Worship</p>\n<p>Hundreds of thousands of people each week have transformative encounters with God through Adult Bible Studies&mdash;Bible-based, Christ-focused Sunday school lessons and midweek Bible studies endorsed by the Curriculum Resources Committee of the The United Methodist Church.

In Christian, you’ll learn: What one word should be descriptive of every Christian How Jesus’ followers should treat those who are outside the faith Why people love Jesus but can’t stand his followers What does is mean to be Christian? Curiously, the term is never used in Scripture. Instead, Christian was a label used by outsiders to define Jesus’ followers. Jesus referenced ‘disciple’ as the key word he used to describe his supporters along with the fact that they would be known for their love – a novel concept for their time – and ours today. Through eight engaging and enlightening sessions, Andy Stanley unpacks these qualities Jesus prescribes for his followers that made them unique. What if believers today embodied these traits? Would the non-believing world put aside its definition of ‘Christian’ and instead know us by our love?

But, as A Heart for the Work makes clear, Malawian medical students learn to confront poverty creatively, experiencing fatigue and frustration but also joy and commitment on their way to becoming physicians. The first ethnography of medical training in the global South, Claire L. Wendland's book is a moving and perceptive look at medicine in a world where the transnational movement of people and ideas creates both devastation and possibility.Wendland, a physician anthropologist, conducted extensive interviews and worked in wards, clinics, and operating theaters alongside the student doctors whose stories she relates. From the relative calm of Malawi's College of Medicine to the turbulence of training at hospitals with gravely ill patients and dramatically inadequate supplies, staff, and technology, Wendland's work reveals the way these young doctors engage the contradictions of their circumstances, shedding new light on debates about the effects of medical training, the impact of traditional healing, and the purposes of medicine.<br></p>","language":"en_US","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/68/9789282010068.jpg","title_long":"Reflections on Life Long Education and the School (Uie Monographs : UNESCO Institution for Education No. 3)","edition":1,"dimensions":"eBook","pages":80,"date_published":"1975","subjects":["Adult education","LC5219 .R45","374"],"authors":["Dave Ravindrakumar H.","Knowles Malcolm S.","Flechsig Karl Heinz","Sheats Paul H.","Kidd James Robbins","Bogdan Michael","Shimbori Michiya","Giere Ursula","Stiemerling Nalini"],"title":"Reflections on Life Long Education and the School (Uie Monographs : UNESCO Institution for Education No. 3)","isbn13":"9789282010068","msrp":"5","binding":"Paperback","isbn":"9282010066"},{"publisher":"Independent Publishers Group (Chicago Review Press)","synopsis":"Humanity rests in the balance as David and Chloe near the end of their journey. * And in their way stands the last enemy either of them ever expected. * Final issue.","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/29/9781646684229.jpg","edition":1,"pages":724,"date_published":"20210407","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Clay McLeod Chapman"],"title":"Origins #6","isbn13":"9781646684229","msrp":"24.95","binding":"eBook","isbn":"1646684222"},{"publisher":"Cokesbury","synopsis":"Beginning with the summer quarter, the focal Bible passages will again appear in print in both the student and teacher books. We will mostly use the Common English Bible (CEB) version of the text, while sometimes including the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) when it will better help students engage and appreciate the biblical texts.\n<p><strong> Summer Theme:<br>\nCommunity</strong><br>\nThis summer, our lessons support the theme of \"Community.\" The writer of the student book lessons is Robert Gardner; the teacher book writer is Martha Myre.</p>\n<p><strong>A New Thing</strong><br>\nSpiritual Practice - Study<br>\nScripture - Deuteronomy 8:1-10 | 1 Kings 18:20-39 | 2 Kings 22:8-20 | Hosea 1:2-11<br>\nIf you look at the texts of this unit in the sequence they are laid out over the four lessons, it may not be immediately apparent why the unit theme is \"A New Thing.&rdquo; While Lesson 1 presents God's charge to ancient Israel to keep the commandments, Lessons 2 and 3 focus on incidents brought about by the people failing to keep the commandments, and Lesson 3 adds the note of divine judgment. It's only when we get to Lesson 4 that the new creation\ntheme emerges. But after the journey the first three lessons takes us through, the need for a fresh start is obvious, and the message of restoration that God announces through Hosea is most welcome. </p>\n<p><strong>A New People</strong><br>\nScripture - Jeremiah 23:1-8 | Daniel 1:8-17 | Daniel 3:19-30 |Nehemiah 9:9-17, 32-33<br>\nSpiritual Practice - Prayer<br>\nWhile the Lord invites all to be people of God, the Old Testament is essentially the story of God's dealings with a specific group of people, the Israelites. The four lessons of this unit give us an opportunity to look at some key stories related to those dealings: God and the remnant, the community's connection to God, God's care for the people in a time of great stress, and how God's love for the people continued despite their unfaithfulness. All these stories have applications to us today, but we begin to learn about God's ways through biblical stories about God and the Israelites.</p>\n<p><strong>A New Way of Life</strong><br>\nScripture - Luke 19:1-10 | John 4:7-30, 39-42 | Luke 10:25-37 | Matthew 15:21-28 | Mark 5:1-20<br>\nSpiritual Practice - Hospitality<br>\nThe Bible passages in the five lessons of this unit are all intended to enlarge our understanding of the word neighbor. Four of the five are incidents that directly involve Jesus, and the fifth is a parable Jesus told expressly to show what it means to be a neighbor, the parable we call the parable of the good Samaritan. All these passages are important, for they elucidate Jesus' summary statement of one of the two most important commandments: \"You must love your neighbor as you love yourself\" (Matthew 22:39).  </p>\nBoth supplementary and complementary to the Adult Bible Studies student book, the teacher book provides small-group leaders, teachers, and facilitators with additional biblical background and exposition and suggestions for guiding group discussion.

Sad to say, this is not the case.</p>\n<p>Having a senior citizens program in the local church can be one of the least expensive and most meaningful outreach of the local church or community association. It requires space, little funding, a dedicated leader, and volunteers, and it can be one of the least costly programs that can be put on by the local church. It is easy to do and easy to manage. The need for a direct and specific program orientated toward seniors in the local church has never been greater than it is today. People are living longer. This is every growing field that truly is white unto harvest. With the changes in our society, increased life expectancy, increase in birth control, and now the wholesale slaughter of unwanted children (called abortion and sometimes birth killing), we are seeing the senior citizen population increasing.</p>","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/11/9781973669111.jpg","edition":2,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":488,"date_published":"20200220","subjects":["Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Dr. Dewey E.

Pastor and author Randy Frazee presents seven ten-minute teachings on how the story of Jesus intersects with the story of our modern day lives. To understand the Bible, says author and pastor Randy Frazee, you need bifocal lenses, because two perspectives are involved. The Lower Story, our story, is actually many stories of men and women interacting with God in the daily course of life. The Upper Story is God's story, the tale of his great, overarching purpose that fits all the individual stories together like panels in one unified mural. The Story of Jesus Participant’s Guide includes DVD teaching notes, discussion questions, between session personal experiences, and also includes seven chapters of the full text of The Story hardcover book as it relates to Jesus, from his birth to the beginning of the church.

In This Tough-on-crime, Security-oriented Era, The New Gold Standard For School Discipline Has Become The Criminal Justice System. While Harsh School Punishment Has Reshaped Schools And Communities Across The Socioeconomic Divide, Nowhere Is The Overlap Between Classroom And Prison More Striking Than At The Orleans Parish Prison, The Site Of A New Orleans Public School Enrolling Primarily Poor African American Boys Expelled Under Zero-tolerance Policies For Minor Infractions Such As Tardiness, But Not Actual Criminal Behavior. The Prison School Examines How And Why Public Schools Take A Punitive Approach To Education And Analyzes How This Criminalizing Mode Influences A Student's Approach Toward Correctional Custody. How Did Schools And Prisons--two Very Different Kinds Of Public Institutions--become So Intertwined, And What Does This Combination Mean For Students, Communities, And, Ultimately, A Democratic Society? How Do We Begin To Unravel The Ties That Bind The Racialized Realities Of Mass School Failure And Mass Incarceration? And What Does This Mean To Segments Of The Population--in Particular, African American Males--who Have Been Systematically Removed From Their Schools And Their Society?--provided By Publisher.

The Result Is A Descent Into The World Of The Truly Fucked Up, A Semi-delirious And Amnesiac Wandering That Finds An End Not In Some Predictable And Cuddly Redemption But In The Solace Of Shared Disillusion. <i>the Fuck-up</i> Is A Must For Any Smugly Self-satisfied Downtown New Yorker, And An Important Addition To The Canon Of Writing About New York.

On a stretch of pavement measuring two metres by thirty he runs a unique clinic. His patients are the destitute and the dispossessed, those who live and die on the streets. The clinic has survived for over a decade, in spite of official disapproval, and will soon be ministering to its 20,000th family. Born and brought up in an orthodox Jewish family near Manchester, as a young adult Preger converted to Catholicism. In 1972 he qualified as a doctor and immediately left to set up a clinic in Bangladesh. Seven years later he was expelled after exposing a government-masterminded racket involving the illegal export of babies for adoption. Undeterred, he set off again the following year to begin his now legendary work in Calcutta. Preger is a man of paradox. To the West Bengali authorities, he is an embarrassment and a nuisance, continually campaigning against official corruption, permanently awaiting trial for practicing without a licence, and vowing to fight the threatened closure of his clinic and resist deportation even at the risk of imprisonment. To the people of Calcutta, whose desperate suffering he struggles tirelessly to alleviate, he is a 'living saint'. A self-confessed manic depressive, Preger relies on his work to sustain him. His two broken marriages - and two deserted children - bespeak a turbulent personal life which he finds difficult to reconcile with his reputation as a paragon of virtue. 'I am certainly no saint - nor have I ever been... A lot of the things that people imagine about someone like myself are just projected fantasies. The fact is that I happen to work with poor people. To me it's the most natural thing in the world.'","language":"en","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/48/9781408836248.jpg","title_long":"Dr Jack: Calcutta's Pavement Doctor","edition":"1","dimensions":"ePub","pages":224,"date_published":"2012","subjects":["General","Adult","English & College Success -> English -> Biography & Autobiography","ATR","TR","English & College Success -> English -> Fiction"],"authors":["Josephs, Jeremy"],"title":"Dr Jack: Calcutta's Pavement Doctor","isbn13":"9781408836248","msrp":"3.99","binding":"Kindle Edition","isbn":"1408836246"},{"publisher":"Bloomsbury Publishing","synopsis":"During the ten years from 1987 to 1997 that he was Director of the Royal National Theatre, Richard Eyre kept a diary - a record that disarmingly captured a life at the heart of British cultural and political affairs. The powerful and the famous inevitably strut and fret upon its pages, but National Service is also a moving personal journey, charted faithfully by a fiercely self-aware and frequently self-doubting individual. The job of grappling with a giant three-headed monster as complex as the Royal National Theatre is laid before us. So are good gossip, brilliant insights into personalities and relationships and a sense of the ridiculous, which Eyre is powerless to suppress. Like other consummate diarists such as Alan Clark and Kenneth Tynan, Richard Eyre has a voice and point of view that jolt the reader into fresh understanding - and are instantly compelling.","language":"en","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/47/9781408806647.jpg","title_long":"National Service: Diary of a Decade at the National Theatre","edition":"1","dimensions":"ePub","pages":452,"date_published":"2011","subjects":["General","Adult","English & College Success -> English -> Biography & Autobiography","ATR","TR","English & College Success -> English -> Fiction"],"authors":["Eyre, Richard"],"title":"National Service: Diary of a Decade at the National Theatre","isbn13":"9781408806647","msrp":"11.99","binding":"Kindle Edition","related":{"Paperback":"0747565902"},"isbn":"1408806649"},{"publisher":"Random House Digital Inc.","synopsis":"No one blends humor and heartbreak like Rita Ciresi, whose award-winning novels are lauded as much for their generous wit as for their unflinching honesty. Ciresi’s crowd-pleasing novel Pink Slip captivated readers and critics alike, introducing two utterly unforgettable characters and a love story both bittersweet and comic. Now Ciresi returns to the people and place of that irresistible bestseller in a riotous and rueful, sexy and poignant tale of married love…a novel that asks how two people who fell desperately, passionately, heartbreakingly in love can sustain a second act. It’s Valentine’s Day, and Lisa Strauss, nee Diodetto, is spending it playing dutiful wife at a $100-a-head benefit instead of in bed with Eben, her hardworking husband of (is it only?) five years. Once upon a time, Lisa, too, was a member of the corporate workaday world--until she fell in love with her boss (Eben), gave birth to a cute but rambunctious son, and gradually morphed into a stay-at-home mom. Somewhere in the mix Lisa also is a writer with ambitions of fame and glory, but those dreams seem to be shrinking, along with her sex life. That is, until a hotshot literary agent shows interest in Lisa’s magnum opus. Suddenly, she has a pen name, and an excerpt of her book appears in Playboy. In between revising chapters, Lisa is trying--and failing miserably--to get pregnant again. She’s going house-hunting with Cynthia Farquhar, the gorgeous blond Realtor/divorcee who has become her closest confidante (and the object of Eben’s secret fantasies). And she’s wondering if this is all marriage is and can ever be: bonded for life to a man who may never again be the red-hot lover of their pre-marriage union. In fact, he just may turn out to be the conflicted protagonist of her novel--a devoted family man whose moral fiber may not be strong enough to withstand the slings and arrows of lust and temptation. As their lives begin to bizarrely mirror aspects of Lisa’s book…as marital life as they know it teeters on the edge of utter chaos, Lisa and Eben search--apart and together--for the answer to the question that has plagued husbands and wives since time immemorial: Can love survive marriage? In a wickedly funny, right-on-target look at love and relationships, Rita Ciresi peels back the layers of a marriage with equal doses of hilarity and humanity. Filled with all the zest, zingers, and unexpected surprises of life, Remind Me Again Why I Married You is this uncommonly gifted author at her lusty and liberating best.","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/71/9780440334071.jpg","title_long":"Remind-me-again-why-i-married-you","edition":2,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":393,"date_published":"20030527","subjects":["Adult","Humorous","Family Life","Contemporary Women","Coming of Age","Literary","English & College Success -> English -> Fiction"],"authors":["Rita Ciresi"],"title":"Remind Me Again Why I Married You","isbn13":"9780440334071","msrp":"98.95","binding":"ePub","related":{"Hardcover":"0385335849"},"isbn":"0440334071"},{"publisher":"Simon & Schuster","synopsis":"The story of a beautiful highland beauty who falls in love with the son of a mystic Havfrau Queen continues.

Madison is having problems -- her ex-live-in lover who walked out on her is trying to walk back in. Her new lover is giving her a hard time. And her father turns out to be a man with deadly secrets.

This is the chilling story of how the man who, with the encouragement of western governments, made his country the most advanced in the Arab world in the 1970s, and through personal ambition led it to disaster at the end of the 1980s, now fights for its survival.","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/34/9781408829134.jpg","title_long":"Saddam-hussein-the-politics-of-revenge","edition":1,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":178,"date_published":"20120302","subjects":["General","Adult","English & College Success -> English -> Biography & Autobiography","ATR","TR","English & College Success -> English -> Fiction"],"authors":["Saïd K.

Adam LeBor, a critically acclaimed author and journalist who covered the Yugoslav Wars for the Independent and The Times, documents the life of a man whose policies instigated four wars, who skilfully exploited the most modern techniques of media management to whip up a nationalist frenzy, and under whose rule bloody campaigns of ethnic cleansing systematically destroyed a once sophisticated multi-ethnic country, and yet who retained for a decade the ability to wrap the 'international community' round his little finger. It gives the inside story of Milosevic's childhood, his marriage to Mira (who gave him an entrée into the highest circles of Yugoslavia's political elite), his rise to power, the looted money (estimated at some $30 billion), the ascendancy of crime over politics (personified in his son Marko's enterprises), his relationships with key figures like Radovan Karadzic and Franjo Tujman, not to mention the many western diplomats, politicians and businessmen with whom he dealt for more than 10 years, and finally the story of his fall from power.","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/03/9781408827703.jpg","edition":1,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":178,"date_published":"20120115","subjects":["General","Adult","English & College Success -> English -> Biography & Autobiography","ATR","TR","English & College Success -> English -> Fiction"],"authors":["Adam LeBor"],"title":"Milosevic","isbn13":"9781408827703","msrp":"16.99","binding":"ePub","related":{"Paperback":"0747561818"},"isbn":"1408827700"},{"publisher":"Bloomsbury Publishing","synopsis":"'Marvellously entertaining and informative' Spectator 'Thrilling' Sunday Times 'An entertaining mix of history, espionage, biography, and post-war sociology' Literary Review _____________________ 'I am going to write the spy story to end all spy stories.'

James Bond was born and would go on to become one of the most successful, enduring and lucrative creations in literature.

No Names Attached. A bold collection of stories about sex that leaves you guessing who wrote what. Bestselling novelists Hillary Jordan and Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan present an elegant, international anthology of erotica that explores the diverse spectrum of desire, written by winners of the Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, PEN Awards, the Women’s Prize for Fiction, Edgar Award, and more. There are stories of sexual obsession and sexual love, of domination and submission. There’s revenge sex, unrequited sex, funny sex, tortured sex, fairy tale sex, and even sex in the afterlife. While the authors are listed in alphabetical order at the beginning of the book, none of the stories are attributed, providing readers with a glimpse into an uninhibited landscape of sexuality as explored by twenty-seven of today’s finest authors.

Svana, a woman of the twenty-first century, is dragged into a strange, unknown world. How is it possible that two rings have thrown her and her twin brother, David, back through time?

As John would say, \"Put your money where your mouth is.\" Be a depressed widow boring the arse off everyone, or get on with life. Your choice.' In The Two of Us Sheila Hancock relived her life with John Thaw - years packed with love and family, work and houses, delight and despair. And then she looked ahead. What next? Gardening, grannying and grumbling, while they all had their pleasures, weren't going to fill the aching void that John had left. 'Live adventurously', a piece of Quaker advice, was hovering in her mind. So, putting her and John's much-loved house in France on the market - too many memories - she embarked, instead, on a series of journeys. She tried holidaying alone, contending with invisibility and budget flights. She tried travelling in a group, but the questions she wanted to ask were never the ones the guide wanted to answer. She tried relaxing - harder than you might think. Finally, heading out of her comfort zone, she found her travels and new discoveries led her back to her past: to consider her generation - the last to experience the Second World War - and the kind of person it made her. Just Me is a book about moving on, but it is also about looking back, and looking anew. Sheila, whether facing down burglars and easyJet staff (cross her at your peril) or making friends with waiters and taxi drivers, whether unearthing secrets in Budapest, getting arrested in Thailand, exulting in the art of Venice or mingling with the Mafia in Milan, is never less than stimulating company. Honest - because if you can't say what you think at seventy-five, when can you? - insightful and wonderfully down-to-earth, she is a woman seizing the future with wit, gusto and curiosity - on her own.","language":"en","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/98/9781408801598.jpg","title_long":"Just Me","edition":"1","dimensions":"ePub","pages":274,"date_published":"2008","subjects":["General","Adult","English & College Success -> English -> Biography & Autobiography","ATR","TR","English & College Success -> English -> Fiction"],"authors":["Hancock, Sheila"],"title":"Just Me","isbn13":"9781408801598","msrp":"9.99","binding":"Kindle Edition","related":{"Paperback":"0747598509"},"isbn":"1408801590"},{"publisher":"Andrews UK","synopsis":"It's a strange thing about writing erotica, that many readers feel compelled to write back, often with experiences and fantasies of their own.

Calling the Wild, from award winning, erotic romance author Lila Dubois is a paranormal erotic romance full of intrigue, suspense, danger, and mystical powers waiting to be unleashed. Find out if two strangers, from different worlds, can overcome all obstacles in a quest for true love! Moira doesn't know who's hunting her, but she knows why. In her youth she unleashed a deadly force that killed everything within range--a strange power she has vowed never to use again. Needing protection, she risks a bit of the old magic to call for backup. She gets more than she asks for. A lot more. A proud, sexually magnetic, enraged centaur who's far from a quiet, obedient servant. Kiron at first tries to intimidate the witch into freeing him, but she possesses more backbone than the average human. When she's attacked again, he realizes she's not a real witch. In fact, she's not even human. And the sparks flying between them have nothing to do with the magical shackles that bind them together. Curiosity grows to admiration, then to a love that in the end may not be enough to protect her. Moira's enemies are closing in, intending to harness her power to restore a dark kingdom that has lain dormant for a thousand years. There's only one, heart-wrenching way out--give herself over to the full extent of her powers hoping that her true destiny lies with Kiron, and not in fulfilling a prophecy of death... *Not intended for readers under the age of 18. *Previously Published: (2010) Samhain Publishing","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/90/9781946363190.jpg","edition":1,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":745,"date_published":"20170402","subjects":["Fantasy","Adult","Fairy Tales, Folk Tales, Legends & Mythology","General","Suspense","English & College Success -> English -> Fiction"],"authors":["Lila Dubois"],"title":"Calling the Wild","isbn13":"9781946363190","msrp":"29.95","binding":"ePub","isbn":"1946363197"},{"publisher":"Kensington","synopsis":"In Post World War I England, Lady Phoebe Renshaw And Her Lady S Maid, Eva Huntford, Encounter An Uncharitable Killer At A Charity Luncheon Sponsored By A Posh School For Girls . . .

A topic that has been building a great deal of buzz within the ranks of Church leadership, but has not yet ignited as an action based movement among North American Christians. That’s 77 million potential Good Samaritans sitting in the pews. And the time is now. The people are ready. The market is ready for the book, START – becoming a Good Samaritan.START’s headliner curriculum (list attached) brings together topical experts, theologians, mega-church pastors, front-line workers, victims, encouragers, and even “unknowns” to offer a complete picture of the problem and a practical understanding of how to be a Good Samaritan right now, right where each of us lives.We are all too painfully aware that the Church today is not known as Good Samaritans. We’re known more as the Priest or the Levite from the story – or worse. Rick Warren put his finger on the aching need for this curriculum and book when he said, “It’s time for a second reformation, not one of theology, but of works.”","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/17/9780310585817.jpg","edition":1,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":1152,"date_published":"20100928","subjects":["Social Issues","General","Spiritual Growth","Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity","English & College Success -> English -> Fiction"],"authors":["Michael Seaton"],"title":"Start With Me","isbn13":"9780310585817","msrp":"14.99","binding":"ePub","related":{"Paperback":"0310325846"},"isbn":"0310585813"},{"publisher":"Bloomsbury UK","synopsis":"Samuel Beckett's long-standing friend, James Knowlson, recreates Beckett's youth in Ireland, his studies at Trinity College, Dublin in the early 1920s and from there to the Continent, where he plunged into the multicultural literary society of late-1920s Paris.

When she died in 1992 at the age of fifty-one, she had published fifteen books of fiction and essays; outrage at her omission from any Booker Prize shortlists led to the foundation of the Orange Prize. Angela Carter sent her friend Susannah Clapp postcards from all over the world, missives which form a paper trail through her life. The pictures she chose were sometimes domestic, sometimes flights of fantasy and surrealism. The messages were always pungent. Here, Susannah Clapp uses postcards – the emails of the twentieth century – to travel through Angela Carter's life, and to evoke her anarchic intelligence, fierce politics, rich language and ribaldry, and the great swoops of her imagination.","language":"en","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/27/9781408828427.jpg","title_long":"A Card From Angela Carter","edition":"1","dimensions":"ePub","pages":113,"date_published":"2012","subjects":["General","Adult","English & College Success -> English -> Biography & Autobiography","ATR","TR","English & College Success -> English -> Fiction"],"authors":["Clapp, Susannah"],"title":"A Card From Angela Carter","isbn13":"9781408828427","msrp":"12.99","binding":"Kindle Edition","related":{"Hardcover":"1408826909"},"isbn":"1408828421"},{"publisher":"Sweetmeats Press","synopsis":"<DIV>This title:<BR><li>features the work of a writer who is becoming a rising star in the erotic literary genre.<BR><li>takes the universal joy of music and gives it a unique erotic twist.<BR><li>is produced to a high standard with a relevant, remarkable, non-generic cover.</DIV>","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/50/9781909181250.jpg","edition":1,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":138,"date_published":"20130306","subjects":["Erotica","General","Adult","Short Stories (single author)","English & College Success -> English -> Fiction","Humanities -> Music -> General"],"authors":["Amélie Hope"],"title":"Raw","isbn13":"9781909181250","msrp":"24.95","binding":"ePub","isbn":"1909181250"},{"publisher":"Pamela Dorman Books","synopsis":"Sick Of His Lies, Cheating Ways, And Complete Lack Of Interest In Fatherhood, Jessica Left Her Boyfriend, Adam, Only Months After She Gave Birth To Their Son--and Never Looked Back.

Reflecting the increasingly global nature of scholarship in the field, well-respected international contributors analyse issues facing practitioners today and consider how these can be most positively embraced to further the international cause of adult learning and social justice.” – Janet Hannah, University of Nottingham. This broad introduction to adult and post-compulsory education offers an overview of the field for students, adult educators and workplace trainers. The book establishes an analytical framework to emphasise the nature of learning and agency of learners; examines the core knowledge and skills that adult educators need; discusses policy, research and history of adult education, and surveys innovations and issues in adult education and learning. It also examines adult learning in different contexts: on-line learning, problem-based learning, organisational and vocational learning. Edited by internationally known academic Griff Foley, the book features chapters from leading contributors in the UK, North America, Australia and worldwide.

And Mas, busy tending lawns, gambling, and struggling to put his Hiroshima past behind him, never had much time for the family he was trying to support. For years now, his resentful daughter has lived a continent away in New York City, and had a life he knew little about. But an anxious phone call from Mari asking for his help plunges the usually obstinate Mas into a series of startling situations from maneuvering in an unfamiliar city to making nice with his tall, blond son-in-law, Lloyd, to taking care of a sickly child…to finding a dead body in the rubble of a former koi pond. \n<p>The victim was Kazzy Ouchi, a half-Japanese millionaire who also happened to be Mari and Lloyd’s boss. Stumbling onto the scene, Mas sees more amiss than the detectives do, but his instinct is to keep his mouth shut. Only when the case threatens his daughter and her family does Mas take action: patiently, stubbornly tugging at the end of a tangled, dangerous mystery. And as he does, he begins to lay bare a tragic secret on the dark side of an American dream.…</p>\n<p>Both a riveting mystery and a powerful story of passionate relationships across a cultural divide, <b>Gasa-Gasa Girl</b> is a tale told with heart and wisdom: an unforgettable portrait of fathers, daughters, and other strangers.</p>","language":"en","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/01/9780385337601.jpg","title_long":"Gasa-Gasa Girl (Mas Arai)","edition":"Illustrated","dimensions":"Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.53 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches","pages":287,"date_published":"2005","subjects":["Japanese Americans","Japanese Americans--Fiction","Millionaires--Crimes against","Millionaires--Crimes against--Fiction","Parent and adult child","Parent and adult child--Fiction","Fathers and daughters","Fathers and daughters--Fiction","Gardeners","Gardeners--Fiction","Gardens","Gardens--Fiction","Japanese Americans--California--Los Angeles--Fiction","Japanese Americans--New York (State)--New York--Fiction","PS3608.I76 G37 2005","813/.6"],"authors":["Hirahara, Naomi"],"title":"Gasa-Gasa Girl (Mas Arai)","isbn13":"9780385337601","msrp":"11.79","binding":"Paperback","related":{"ePub":"0440335329","Kindle Edition":"0440335329"},"isbn":"0385337604"},{"publisher":"R & E Pub","synopsis":"Carl Danziger.

The insights Cohen provides into subculture and mass morality are as relevant today as they were when the book was originally published in 1972, as illustrated by the author's introduction for this new edition, in which he tracks moral panics over the last thirty years, commenting on the demonization of young offenders and asylum seekers and on the <b>News of the World</b>'s 'name and shame' campaign against paedophiles.<br>\nRevisiting the theory of moral panic and exploring the way in which the concept has been used, this new edition features a select bibliography of key texts for further reading.

E. Kerr has written some twenty-five books for young adults in the past quarter century. For novels like Dinky Hocker Shoots Smack!, Gentlehands, Night Kites, and the autobiographical ME ME ME ME ME: Not a Novel, Kerr was honored with the prestigious Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American Library Association in 1993. Notably, she is the first young adult novelist to speak openly about her lesbianism. With Presenting M. E. Kerr, Updated, Alleen Pace Nilsen provides a fresh, thoroughly revised look at the achievements of this popular writer for young adults. Like its warmly received predecessor, the study presents a biographical profile of Kerr and discusses the features characterizing her books, among them Kerr's deftness at creating names and her skill at composing dialogue. But this new edition also inspects the substantial body of work produced by Kerr in the intervening decade - including the acclaimed young adult novels Linger and Deliver Us from Evie - as well as the extensive critical literature written about her efforts. In addition, Nilsen traces homosexual elements throughout Kerr's work, examining with sensitivity and respect the ways in which the writer uses various other forms of prejudice, such as ethnic and socioeconomic differences among people, as metaphors for homophobia. In separate chapters, Nilsen treats Kerr's larger body of work - comprising adult fiction and nonfiction, works of mystery and suspense, and novels for children in the middle grades - and analyzes her style, humor, and concern with the underdog. Throughout, readers are treated to a wealth of insights into the writer's art and life, ranging from quotations from Nilsen's interviews with Kerr to selections of Kerr's photographs.\n\n                        <p>A critical introduction to the life and work of the young adult novelist M.

Shops, launderettes, streets, bars, cafes and people's houses are the settings for much of their work, and when they do appear in schools and colleges, they are most likely to be found in corridors, eating areas and student common-rooms. Their work is not organized by subject, syllabi or lessons; it is about conversation and community, a commitment to local democracy and self-organization, and is often unpredictable and risky. Mark Smith offers an analysis of the subtle and difficult activity of intervening in other peoples' lives, of conversing with purpose, and of engaging with people to broaden opportunity and to effect change in their lives and communities.","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/00/9780335231300.jpg","edition":1,"dimensions":"Page Fidelity","pages":864,"date_published":"19940916","subjects":["Adult & Continuing Education","General","Professional, Career & Trade -> Education -> Adult & Continuing Education","Professional, Career & Trade -> Education -> General"],"authors":["Mark Smith"],"title":"Local Education","isbn13":"9780335231300","msrp":"37.99","binding":"eBook","related":{"Paperback":"0335192742"},"isbn":"0335231306"},{"publisher":"R&L Education","synopsis":"New graduate students are often unaware of the many hazards and pitfalls that occur during the dissertation process: intensive schedules, dwindling motivation, difficult or unavailable mentors, and research and publication complications.

However, This Enlightening Volume Seeks Instead To Invite Us Deeper Into Young Arab-australian Men's Lives As We Explore Their Vocational Aspirations And Working Experiences Within Highly Racialised And Hierarchical Industries. Young Migrant Identities Is An In-depth Exploration Into The Lives Of Arab-australian Young Men Living In Western Sydney With Creative Career Aspirations. Indeed, Not Only Does Idriss Explore How These Men Develop Interests In Fields Such As Music, Filmmaking, And Design, But She Also Examines The Multilinear Routes That They Take To Turn These Interests Into Vocational Identities. However, In The Local Migrant Communities In Which These Young Men Live, Creative Identities Are Seen To Compromise Individual And Familial Prospects For Social Mobility, And Artistic Interests Tend To Go Unsupported. Thus, This Book Also Strives To Offer New Insights About How Notions Of Gender, Ethnicity And Social Class Are Experienced Because Of These Young Men's Risky Career Ambitions. A Timely Volume, Young Migrant Identities Draws Together A Range Of Theoretical Issues And Debates, Engaging With Sociological Approaches To Race And Social Class, Creative And Cultural Economies, And Studies On Youth.

These practices take place in diverse settings from formal educational contexts to institutionally interstitial realms to fluid and explicitly contested everyday spaces. This edited collection includes twelve richly rendered ethnographic case studies written from the perspective of practitioner-ethnographers who straddle the roles of educator and ethnographic researcher. Drawing on distinct theoretical framings, these contributors illuminate the ways in which adults engaged in teaching and learning participate in cultural practices that intersect with other dimensions of social life, such as work, recreation, community engagement, personal development, or political action. By juxtaposing ethnographic inquiries of formal and informal learning spaces, as well as intentional and unintended challenges to mainstream adult teaching and learning, this collection provides new understandings and critical insights into the complexities of adults’ educational experiences.","language":"English","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/32/9781498581332.jpg","edition":27,"dimensions":"ePub","pages":512,"date_published":"20191108","subjects":["Adult & Continuing Education","Cultural","Professional, Career & Trade -> Education -> Adult & Continuing Education","Social Sciences -> Anthropology -> Cultural Anthropology"],"authors":["Author"],"title":"Contested Spaces of Teaching and Learning","isbn13":"9781498581332","msrp":"105.0","binding":"ePub","related":{"Hardcover":"1498581323"},"isbn":"1498581331"},{"publisher":"SAGE Publications","synopsis":"<p><br> Be the best mentor you can be with these state-of-the-art strategies!

Compte tenu de l'importance accordée, dans la perspective contemporaine à l'apprentissage tout au long de la vie, à l'apprentissage réalisé à l'âge adulte et à la reconnaissance des acquis et des compétences développées en dehors de programmes scolaires, il parait fructueux de retracer la présence de l'écrit dans la vie quotidienne des adultes et des jeunes adultes pour mieux appréhender l'apprentissage qu'ils y font ou pourraient y faire. Cette attention est d'autant plus importante quand il s'agit de mieux comprendre l'apprentissage informel des jeunes adultes et des adultes n'ayant pas de diplôme d'études secondaire qui ont, moins que les autres, accès aux activités de formation les plus structurées offertes par les établissements d'enseignement ou les entreprises.À partir des deux groupes de travaux de recherche, le premier sur les pratiques sociales de l'écrit, le deuxième sur l'apprentissage expérientiel, informel, au travail ou dans la vie de tous les jours, cet ouvrage permet de mieux comprendre le rôle que joue l'écrit dans l'apprentissage hors de l'école et à l'âge adulte de personnes qui sont souvent sans premier diplôme du secondaire.<br></p>","language":"fre","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/69/9782763715469.jpg","title_long":"Gestion en contexte interculturel Approches, problématiques, pratiques et plongées","edition":1,"dimensions":"eBook","pages":208,"date_published":"2021-06-24","subjects":["Adult & Continuing Education","General","Professional, Career & Trade -> Education -> Adult & Continuing Education","Professional, Career & Trade -> Education -> General"],"authors":["Rachel Bélisle"],"title":"Ecrire, lire et apprendre dans la vie adulte","isbn13":"9782763715469","msrp":"21.95","binding":"eBook","isbn":"276371546X"},{"publisher":"University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.","synopsis":"<p>This book is a volume in the Penn Press Anniversary Collection.

However, the New Majority of our students are older, likely to swirl among institutions, and have significant adult responsibilities outside of the classroom. Academic Transformation: A Design Approach for the New Majority is a call to transform colleges and universities to meet the academic and student experience needs of New Majority students and for adult educators to become advocates, allies, and resources for needed reforms. Book contributors, including faculty, staff and administrators at public, private and community colleges, provide insights for this transformation. Taking a personalized approach based on a wide range of experiences, the contributors provide a framework for cross-campus conversations and collaborations to help stakeholders across the institution to understand New Majority learners’ strengths, needs and challenges within an increasingly competitive educational market.

Most people believe in one or another and assert that theirs is true. Many religious people also assert that every other religion believed in by anyone else ranges from completely false to highly suspect. There are religions that believe in many gods, others that believe in one god, and there are even religions that preach no gods. There are also sects within religions that disavow other sects within the same religion. There are religions that are extinct and new religions formed all the time. The reformation of older religions is also ongoing. What all religions seem to have in common are (1) supernatural beliefs that others don't believe and (2) absolutely no real demonstrable evidence that can be repeated and shown to others in support of any of their supernatural beliefs. If you think about it, religion truly is a funny thing in every sense of that word. Many people define their religion to be the all-encompassing paradigm of their existence that causes them to do completely virtuous, altruistic things. Yet religion also causes others, who are equally or even more pious, to commit mass murder. And both have been true for many religions throughout history. This volume takes a broad and satirical look at religions writ large, mainly to question. It's aimed largely at atheists and those on the fence, but theists may be encouraged to read it too and question for themselves. How did you acquire religion? Why? What do you believe? Why? Why not believe other equally implausible things that others do believe? This volume is just a light hearted attempt to ask.

A Christian course for the twenty-first century, Pilgrim offers an approach of participation, not persuasion. Following the practice of the ancient disciplines of biblical reflection and prayer with quotes from the Christian tradition throughout the ages, Pilgrim assumes little or no knowledge of the Christian faith. Individuals or small groups on the journey of discipleship in the Episcopal tradition can use Pilgrim at any point. There are many different aspects to helping people learn about the Christian faith. We have taken as our starting point Jesus' summary of the commandments. We are called to offer our lives to God through loving God with all our mind, soul, strength and heart and to love our neighbor as ourselves. Learning about Christian faith and growing in Christian faith is about more than what we believe. It's also about the ways in which we pray and develop our relationship with God, about the way we live our lives and about living in God's vision for the Church and for the world.There are two stages of material in Pilgrim. There are four short Pilgrim books (each comprising a course of six sessions) in the \"Follow\" Stage designed for those who are enquirers and very new to the faith. Then there are four short Pilgrim books (again, each comprising a six-session course) in the \"Grow\" Stage designed for those who want to go further and learn more.Pilgrim is made up of two parts, each with four courses contained in four booklets: Follow: Do you turn to Christ? Releasing in March 20161. Turning to Christ2. The Lord's Prayer3. The Commandments4. The BeatitudesGrow: Will you continue in the Apostles' teaching and fellowship? Releasing October 20165. The Creeds6. The Eucharist7. The Bible8. Church & KingdomEach course offers six sessions each that combine a simple prayer, reflection on a biblical selection using lectio divina, an article by a modern writer, and reflection questions. The short courses in the four \"Follow\" stage books can be approached in any order. Together, we believe they offer a balanced introduction to the Christian life and journey. Our hope and prayer is that Pilgrim will help to introduce people to the Christian Way and also equip them to live their whole lives as disciples of Jesus Christ. It will help inquirers and those new to the Christian faith as well as those who are new to The Episcopal Church or Episcopalians who wish to refresh and renew their learning commitment to Christ.The aim of the \"Grow\" stage is to help people to learn the essentials for a life of discipleship. A disciple is to be called to live in a rhythm of being with Jesus in community and to be sent out to live out the Christian faith in the whole of his or her life. Disciples need the support of other Christians and to be part of a community. We need opportunities to reflect and pray together and to explore the riches of our faith. The Grow stage supports that process both for new Christians and for those who have been Christians for many years. Some groups who use the Grow material will be moving on from the Follow stage of Pilgrim. Some will be specially convened just for this stage. Component descriptions: Leader's GuideThe Pilgrim Leader's Guide has lots of helpful material for those who are leading any Pilgrim Group. A single guide covers all eight booklets and gives an overview of the program as well as a process of how to lead a group of youth or adults in discussing the material. This is an essential tool for anyone who wishes to offer any portion of Pilgrim in a small group, whether in church, school, or home. Worship material, liturgies for enrollment in the catechumenate, and additional resources are also included.<br></p>","language":"eng","image":"https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/56/9780898699456.jpg","title_long":"Pilgrim - The Beatitudes A Course for the Christian Journey - The Beatitudes","edition":2,"dimensions":"eBook","pages":64,"date_published":"2016-03-01","subjects":["Episcopalian","Adult","Social Sciences -> Religion -> Christianity"],"authors":["Stephen Cottrell","Steven Croft"],"title":"Pilgrim - The Beatitudes","isbn13":"9780898699456","msrp":"10.95","binding":"eBook","related":{"Paperback":"0898699444"},"isbn":"0898699452"},{"publisher":"Page Publishing, Inc.","synopsis":"<p>Eileen Albano, a newly admitted attorney, has landed a job at Weiss & Dorfman, a plaintiff's personal injury law firm located in lower Manhattan.
