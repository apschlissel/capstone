      "synopsis": "A collection of five erotic stories with mixed themes including sex in public, ménage, exhibitionism and older woman/younger man. No Knickers by Elizabeth McWilliams Usually a reserved young lady and model employee, when Madeleine forgets to pack a vital item of underwear, she is inspired to spend the day chasing illicit thrills. Leaving her usual, dutiful self back in the office, she takes a chance on an attractive stranger in a café who is more than prepared to take advantage of her lack of lingerie. Madeleine forgets her inhibitions along with her knickers, and boldly embraces the opportunity to explore her exhibitionist tendencies and indulge herself in an intimate and sensuous encounter. Between The Crosshairs by Troy Seate The American Jersey Shore gang might be dysfunctional, but the babes in Crosshairs are naughty, nice, and oh so different. This is a tale in which a young man finds himself in a strange place that leads to an illicit, never to be forgotten encounter with two lusty and very creative ladies. Mad About The Boy by Jade Taylor Mel doesn't cheat; it's a rule. Even if she's stuck in an engagement to a man she doesn't want to marry, even if she's been sexually frustrated for far too long, she doesn't cheat. But there's a boy at work she likes - and he's so young he's definitely a boy. Mel doesn't sleep with younger men. But the way he looks at her has her tempted, makes her wet, makes her wonder what it would be like to be with him. And on a night out the \"boy\" shows her that rules are made to be broken, and shows her how much of a man he actually is ... Moving Violation by Lolita Lopez Bella craves a little danger every now and then. Risky, mind-blowing sex on her apartment balcony? Yes, please! But her policeman lover, Jack, refuses to give into Bella's requests for illicit trysts. He's happy to indulge her love of spanking and rougher play but anything that would risk his career is off-limits. One nighttime drive down a secluded lakeside road is all Bella needs to change Jack's mind. She'll show him how deliciously naughty breaking the rules can be. Shall We Dance? by Landon Dixon John was down on his luck, needed money for his family, badly. He was nursing a drink and his woes when Olivia came into the bar, slid onto the stool next to him and said, 'I like married men to fuck me.' He was desperate enough to take her up on it. There was only the matter of price. Just how steep soon became clear.",

So when she has the chance to share the grandest gala of all with Iris, the temptation will prove irresistible . . .   “Fans of steamy sex scenes laced with magic realism will thoroughly enjoy this ‘Pleasure Quartet’ addition.” —Library Journal   Summer: In Rio for the latest Ball—an erotic fete of the senses—Summer still craves an experience that seems just out of reach. A back alley in the Brazilian city of Recife seems an unlikely place to find what she’s looking for, but in Noah Ballard’s passionate embrace, she may finally give herself over to an ecstatic symphony of exquisite pleasure and liberating surrender . . .",

      "synopsis": "An Xcite Books collection of five erotic stories with mixed themes including m/f, m/m and BDSM. Power Games by Roxy Martin Sexy Vincent Carlton calls Kirsten's boyfriend into the office with free tickets to the theatre, Chris is oblivious to the price he will have to pay for them. Kirsten though, isn't so dumb; with Chris away, she asks Vincent what he thinks he's doing. Vincent confesses he is planting the seeds for his desires, but he doesn't just want to have sex with her, he wants it all. Kirsten realises it's a power game, and with a boyfriend with whom satisfaction is never guaranteed, she decides that she is going to be the one in charge. Box by Elise Hepner It probably wasn't prudent for a corporate executive who works in the upper floors of a skyscraper to be afraid of elevators. But Lanie Fox did have kick-ass legs. When Charlie Wright, a sarcastic, sinfully sexy coworker, corners her after an awful meeting she's determined to prove him wrong about her crippling fear inside the death trap. His promise to distract her involves more than his annoying commentary. In fact, his tongue isn't doing a whole lot of talking. But they manage to find many uses for it - and Lanie's fear melts away in lieu of his less than conversational convincing. The Ties of Friendship by L.A. Fields Julio and Chris share a perfect balance in sex, work and home life - but Julio's sure Chris is sleeping with someone else in the office. When that someone engages Chris in a kinky bondage game that involves a tie Julio bought him, business and pleasure will never be the same again. Striking a Balance by Marlene Yong Amy has a problem. A successful executive, she is conscious of something lacking in her existence. When another member of the staff loses some vital information, she sees a way to fill the gap. But what are the risks? And into what unknown, possibly dangerous, territory would she be embarking? Sassafraz is Burning by Giselle Renarde When celebrity hot spot Sassafraz catches fire, the entire office watches it burn from their lofty glass tower. The event silences everyone, and reminds Isobel that anything can happen at any time. If Sassafraz can burn, so can she. In all her life, she's only slept with one man. If the end came tomorrow, she'd regret not making a move on Ahmed, her co-worker crush. The fire says, 'Do it now!' and Isobel listens. These stories have also been published in Corporate Affairs",

      "synopsis": "National bestselling author Lisa Cach’s erotic, passionate story continues in Part Two of the series about Nimia—the Roman Empire slave girl whose prophetic gift is unloosed by sexual encounters. Reunited with Clovis, now king of his barbarian tribe, Nimia and he “celebrate” sexually. Frequently. But sometimes he takes it too far, subjecting her to erotic activities that make her wonder if she’d be better off with her former master, Sygarius. She’s in love with Clovis, though, and he says he loves her, too… But there’s a coldness in his eyes that makes her wonder if he really does—or if he’s just using her prophetic gift for his own gain. King Sygarius, meanwhile, wants Nimia back. When he captures her and sexually enslaves her again, she discovers a crystal chalice inscribed with a design that echoes those tattooed on her body. And when Clovis rescues her from Sygarius, she steals the chalice to take with her. A Christian priest suspects it’s the Holy Grail, but Nimia has a strong feeling it’s a remnant of her lost tribe, the Phanne. But even the chalice cannot tell her if the child she carries belongs to Clovis… or to his greatest enemy: Sygarius.",

H. Lawrence&rsquo;s last novel is one of the major works of fiction of the twentieth century. Filled with scenes of intimate beauty that explore the emotions of a lonely woman trapped in a sterile marriage and her growing love for the robust gamekeeper of her husband&#39;s estate. The most controversial of Lawrence&rsquo;s books, &#160; Lady Chatterley&rsquo;s Lover &#160;joyously affirms the author&rsquo;s vision of individual regeneration through sexual love. The book&rsquo;s power, complexity, and psychological intricacy make this a completely original work-a triumph of passion, an erotic celebration of life.<br></p><p>&ldquo;Nobody concerned with the novel in our century can afford not to read it.&rdquo;&mdash;Lawrence Durrell, author of the Alexandria Quartet<br></p><p>&ldquo;The greatest imaginative novelist of our generation.&rdquo; &mdash;E.M.

Now, The Popular Comedian Delivers <i>it's What He Would've Wanted,</i> A Brutally Funny, Highly Charged, And Moving Novel About A Directionless Thirty-year-old Man's Belated Transition Into Adulthood. <p> Our Narrator And Protagonist Is Shea Hickson, A Commitment-phobic Just-turned-thirty-year-old With Somewhat Adolescent Leanings. Shea Lives Off Lottery Winnings And Spends His Time Blindly Serving A Secret Organization Whose Stated Duty Is To Seek Truth, Which, Though Shea Doesn't Quite Realize It, Turns Out To Be A Small-time Terrorist Gig. Shea's Parents Appear To Be A Quintessentially Comfortable, Suburban Middle-class Couple, And When Sons Shea And Orwell (named After Che Guevara And George, Their Father Having Been Something Of A Nostalgic Radical) Arrive For Christmas Eve, All Seems As It Should Be. But When Shea Turns A Corner To Find His Father, A Bbc Weatherman, Hanging From The Light Fixture, The Son's Disaffected Existence Is Turned Upside Down. Worse, Shea's Discovery Of An Encoded Journal His Father Had Been Keeping Uncovers Shocking Revelations About His Father's Disappointed Life As A Parent, Husband, And Disillusioned Minor Celebrity. Jolted From His Emotional Ennui, Shea Determines To Figure Out What Drove His Father To His Death And, In The Process Of Unraveling The Hickson Family's Increasingly Distasteful Secrets, Comes To Better Understand Himself. <p> With Wry Humor And Savage Undercurrents, The Story Winds Through The Seamier Side Of London Life -- Skirting The Worlds Of Television, Newspapers, And Small-scale Urban Terrorism. Buoyed By Hughes's Edgy Humor And Seinfeldian Observations About Modern Life, <i>it's What He Would've Wanted</i> Dissects And Mutilates Traditional Family Values As It Maps One Son's Attempt To Piece Together A World Fractured By Alienation, Paranoia, And Conflict.</p><h3>book Magazine</h3><p>there's A Grand And Ignoble Postwar British Literary Tradition Of Chronicling The Whimpering (usually Male) Agonies Of Delayed But Inevitable Adulthood. In Our Post-tarantino World, Such Narratives Now Tend To Come Laced With Violence, Macabre Humor And A Bit Of Conspiracy Theory. Hughes' New Book Combines The Standard Coming-of-age Story With Such Neogothic Plot Twists. Shea Hickson, Hughes' Thirtysomething Alter Ego, Becomes A Man Upon The Death Of His Father, A Socialist Tv Weatherman With A Dodgy Past Who Left A Cryptic Suicide Note. For All Its Indulgences And Absurdities, There's Much Dark Wit And Narrative Action Within The Pages Of This Book. Hickson Is A Loser Of Epic Dimension, To Be Sure, But He's A Funny, Likable Chap Whose Misadventures Ultimately Prove Surprisingly Endearing. The Author, However, A Well-known Irish-born Comedian Who Lives In London, Lacks The Raw Talent And Generous Self-deprecation Of Nick Hornby, From Whose Style This Sardonic Novel Borrows.<br> &#151;chris Jones <br> <br></p>",

They've both grown up and live in a part of Long Island that's not the Gold Coast or the tony South Shore. Sleazy canal dives and flaking amusement parks and boardwalks is where they hang out with his childhood pal, Larry Louperino, and his girl.\" \"They don't live on the water, go on family vacations, or away to college. They aren't black, Jewish, rich or even middle class. His mom keeps house, and his estranged father freelances photos for a skin magazine. Eddie and Larry are townies - \"hitters,\" in local parlance. They did their time in school until they graduated and then they went to work: Larry for his mobbed up uncle, Eddie slaving in a union job at the supermarket and dreaming of sailing away, on the boat his grandfather left him.\" \"What Eddie hasn't anticipated in his life is love. What he also hasn't anticipated is getting arrested. Worse, the person who comes to his aid is his father.\"--BOOK JACKET.",

Thea’s early life, however, has much in common with Cather’s own.</p>\n<p>Set from 1885 to 1909, the novel traces Thea’s long journey from her fictional hometown of Moonstone, Colorado, to her source of inspiration in the Southwest, and to New York and the Metropolitan Opera House. As she makes her way in the world from an unlikely background, Thea distills all her experiences and relationships into the power and passion of her singing, despite the cost. <i>The Song of the Lark</i> presents Cather’s vision of a true artist.</p>\n\n\n                        <p>In the Cather tradition, a memorable heroine emerges as a woman of strength and hope who works to build a life that affirms her unflagging spirit.\n</p>",

      "synopsis": "<p>April and Wil couldn't be more different, but both of them are spending the summer at Wellness Canyon -- otherwise known as a weight-loss camp. <br><br> April knows that if she could just drop a little weight, she would be popular like she's always wanted. She's saved up for months to afford Wellness Canyon, which is more like a posh spa than a sleepaway camp. While April can't wait to jump into all the activities, Wil can't wait to get out of there. Her parents own a chain of high-profile fitness centers, and she's pretty sure her mom and dad sent her to Wellness Canyon to slim down before any embarrassing stories about their obese daughter hit the gossip pages. To get revenge on her parents, Wil decides she's going to gain weight at Wellness Canyon. <br><br> It's bad enough that they have to share a room, but things really get ugly when April and Wil both fall for Colin, the sarcastic camp hottie. Are April and Wil destined to be frenemies all summer, or can they overcome their sizeable differences? Filled with everything great about summer camp (and none of the calories), this is a funny, emotional novel about learning to accept yourself -- no matter what your size.</p><h3>VOYA</h3><p>Born to diet, this reviewer appreciates the isolated perspectives of Paley's protagonists sounded by svelte torturers who remind them of genetic heritage, conflicting willpower, the societal and self-imposed shame of plus-sized spandex. Skillfully employing alternating limited omniscient points of view, Paley introduces two teens leaving for Wellness Canyon, a pricey fat camp designed to cultivate healthy lifestyle and weight loss. Wil, the hostile, spoiled, deceptive daughter of wealthy fitness-club entrepreneurs, is railroaded into attending camp by parents who care more about image than feelings. April, daughter of a disabled, diabetic, single parent, earns funds to attend camp, determined to remake herself from a wannabe into a some-body. As roommates, the two clash on multiple levels, each unaware of the other's frailties. Together they discover that even Wellness Canyon has its cliques and intentional cruelties. The two main characters are well drawn and compelling; the supporting characters (staff, parents, other campers) are sketchier or superficial. Each chapter opens with snippets from a character's food and exercise journal, Wil's providing delightfully cynical smiles. Cover art, a triple-layer s'more overlaid with the universal sign for no, invites readers to experience a different kind of summer camp. Friendship, acceptance, and health themes are clear and usually not addressed with heavy-handedness. A prank with laxatives, similar to one involving recently prosecuted real-life New York teens, results in rather mild admonishment. Overall the book is an intriguing adventure of two unlikely bunkmates bound by size and unrealized needs for companionship.</p>",

Delia keeps her distance from others though she has a good friend in Aunt Shirley who helps her to realize that all people have hurts and problems. Through her conversations with Shirley and her explorations in art class, Delia uncovers memories of a car accident, which lead her to discover a hurtful secret at the centre of her family. <p><p><p>Shirley is compassionate and honest, though she doesn't allow Delia to wallow in self-pity and anger. She shares with Delia her own hurts and disappointments and so does the art teacher, Ms. Murti. Delia discovers that she's been self-absorbed and has built walls to separate herself from others. <p><p><p>Gradually, she is able to accept truth, and to be honest about her pain. She is able to consider that life is full of terrible beautiful aching mystery and that sometimes a coincidence is more than coincidence, it may have to do with something greater, with the alignment of universal forces - <i>with the making of a wave.</i><p></p><h3>School Library Journal</h3><p><P>Gr 6-8 <p> Delia, at the age of six, was involved in a car accident that left her face scarred and her parents' marriage in ruins. Ever since, she has kept to herself. Now 12, she is starting to question what really happened the day of the accident and why her mother left. A newfound interest in art, the power of a good book, and a few caring adults help Delia begin to heal. This novel does a fine job of using the changing nature of water to illustrate the changes in the girl. Delia is able to explore her feelings through painting and reading when she feels she has no other options. However, the power of this message is blunted by the stilted, present-tense narration and the lack of context for the conversations that take place between characters. A chapter from the point of view of Delia's mother heightens the disjointed feel of this first novel. Still, readers who are willing to persevere will find a few quiet, elegant moments in the story.-<I>Melissa Rabey, Frederick County Public Libraries, Frederick, MD</I> </P></p>",

      "synopsis": "<p>Ever since her mother passed away, Katie's been alone in her too-big house with her genius dad, who restores old paintings for a living. Katie takes a summer job at a garden estate, where, with the help of two brothers and a glamorous librarian, she soon becomes embroiled in decoding a mystery. There are secrets and shadows at the heart of <i>Nothing but Ghosts</i>: symbols hidden in a time-darkened painting, and surprises behind a locked bedroom door. But most of all, this is a love story&mdash;the story of a girl who learns about love while also learning to live with her own ghosts.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Coping with loss and uncovering secrets are staples of YA fiction, but Kephart (House of Dance) skillfully uses nuanced characters and resonant imagery to make the familiar feel new and magical. Sixteen-year-old Katie D'Amore and her father live in an old &ldquo;heirloom&rdquo; house, one that's far too large following the recent death of Katie's mother. Her father restores paintings&mdash;bringing torn, stained and begrimed canvases back to life&mdash;and Katie has taken a summer job as a gardener for the town recluse, Miss Martine, which offers another kind of resurrection. But neither can leave grief behind. Orders to excavate an unlikely spot for a new gazebo lead Katie to investigate the mystery behind Miss Martine's sudden withdrawal from the world. Her search parallels her father's current restoration project, which also gives tantalizing glimpses into an old tragedy and the still-open wounds it left behind. Kephart's evocative writing and gentle resolution offer healing and hope as her characters come to terms with their losses. As Katie says, &ldquo;Things disappear and vanish... and after that all you can do is keep the idea of them bright inside yourself.&rdquo; Ages 12&ndash;up. (July)</p>",

The novel opens when narrator James Patrick (JP) has just lost his grandmother. The son of a fragile mother and mentally disabled father, JP begins to realize just how much his grandmother held them together. When his childlike mother attempts to take charge, she moves them to a rambling old farmhouse that she wins in a contest for invoking a Harpo Marx quote (When she came home from work each day she wanted to see `a face in every window' ). JP becomes increasingly distressed as his mother invites an odd assortment of outcasts, artists and musicians to live with them. Nolan takes readers on an emotional roller-coaster ride right along with JP, who initially holes up in his room, trying to distance himself from the unwelcome visitors, then opens his door and heart little by little as he begins to accept his new role in an ever-changing family. In addition to a supporting cast as compelling and offbeat as the main characters, the author delivers a profound and heartwarming message about the various manifestations of love. Ages 12-up. (Oct.)

Carter's deeply affecting portrait of a troubled young man's desperate attempt to escape from his problems is a gripping adventure filled with drama and emotion that will have even the most reluctant reader tearing through the pages.<br><br>Andy is tired. Tired of the way everyone has treated him his entire life, especially his alcoholic father. And things only get worse when he goes to stay in the Lodge, their family's cabin in the middle of the Wisconsin woods. This time he just can't take it anymore, and he decides to walk away&#151;into the depths of the wilderness, and of his own mind. Soon the hallucinations set in, and things really start to get out of control. Will Andy ever be able to find the way out?</p><h3>Children's Literature</h3><p>Fifteen-year-old Andy has heard of the Australian walkabout; now he is ready for his own walkaway. His macho, posturing, critical, alcoholic father is drinking heavily again; his mother just shrugs and sighs; his older brother is cruelly indifferent, bent on his own imminent escape to Yale; and Andy himself feels headed toward a recurrence of the mental breakdown that left him catatonic and hospitalized a year ago. So he literally walks away. With his survival kit packed, and his head meds left behind, he walks off alone into the Wisconsin woods, knowing that whatever happens to him would be better than going home again. The portrait of Andy's alcoholic father is fairly cliched, though perhaps, to borrow a line from Tolstoy, all families with alcoholic parents are the same. And it is utterly unbelievable that Andy's brother Rodge is bound for Yale: if he were really Yale material, he would be spending his summer developing a program for sustainable development in Bolivia and working on his concerto audition for the Wisconsin symphony, rather than drinking and womanizing in the backwoods with his buddies. But once Andy walks away, the book becomes riveting: Andy faces a truly untenable situation, tormented both by his hideous family situation and his own unraveling sanity, and pursued relentlessly by the long arm of the unsympathetic law. Carter is unsparing in presenting Andy with no viable solution whatsoever to his unbearable predicament&#151;and yet managing to close the novel with some believable, if meager, measure of hope.

Skate and her boyfriend Perry are madly in love, inseparable&#8212;until now, when Perry goes off to Rutgers. Rosie is shyer than Skate, but she&#8217;s drawn to Nick, a boy in their Alateen group. What happens to Rosie and Skate in a few tumultuous weeks is deftly shaded, complex, and true. Readers will be caught up in each girl&#8217;s shifting feelings as the story plays out within the embrace of their warmhearted community.</p><h3>The New York Times - Ned Vizzini</h3><p>New Jersey is a teenage state: it looks awkward in places, has questionable ethics from time to time and plays perennial underdog to New York. Perhaps this is why it's home to so much good young adult literature, to which we can add Beth Ann Bauman's novel, <i>Rosie and Skate.</i> Set on the Jersey Shore after the tourists have gone home, the novel uses the empty storefronts and windy beaches of autumn to explore loss, confusion and love as two sisters struggle with their alcoholic father and try out adult roles they are not quite ready for&#8230;Impressively, this novel never condescends to younger readers. In capturing the miscues of first love and shifting family dynamics, <i>Rosie and Skate</i> is as sharp as a splinter on the boardwalk.</p>",

      "synopsis": "<p><P>Sixteen-year-old Amal makes the decision to start wearing the hijab full-time and everyone has a reaction. Her parents, her teachers, her friends, people on the street. But she stands by her decision to embrace her faith and all that it is, even if it does make her a little different from everyone else. <P>Can she handle the taunts of towel head, the prejudice of her classmates, and still attract the cutest boy in school? Brilliantly funny and poignant, Randa Abdel-Fattah's debut novel will strike a chord in all teenage readers, no matter what their beliefs.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>With an engaging narrator at the helm, Abdel-Fattah's debut novel should open the eyes of many a reader. Headstrong and witty, 16-year-old Amal, an Australian-Muslim-Palestinian (That means I was born an Aussie and whacked with some seriously confusing identity hyphens) decides during winter break from her posh private school that she's ready to wear the hijab, the Muslim head scarf, fulltime, as a testament to her faith. Amal knows she will face discrimination by classmates and misinformed people but she is committed to her decision; her parents are initially concerned, but ultimately rally behind her. Their worries, in fact, are well-founded: Amal attracts her share of stares and taunts both at school and around town, but she finds strength, not only from her convictions, but from her close-knit group of friends, who for various reasons-being Japanese, Jewish, nerdy or body-conscious-are perceived as being outside the norm. As Amal struggles with her identity in a post-9/11 world (Do you have any idea how it feels to be me, a <I>Muslim</I>, today? I mean, just turn on the television, open a newspaper.... It feels like I'm drowning in it all), her faith-and an array of ever-ready quips-help her navigate an often-unforgiving world. Using a winning mix of humor and sensitivity, Abdel-Fattah ably demonstrates that her heroine is, at heart, a teen like any other. This debut should speak to anyone who has felt like an outsider for any reason. Ages 12-up. <I>(May)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information</p>",

One day, after Tilly has spent nearly thirty years without a family, drinking herself to the brink of death, her niece Stella—who has been leading her own life of empty promise in New York City—arrives on the doorstep of Tilly’s desert trailer. <i>The Gin Closet</i> unravels the strange and powerful intimacy that forms between them. With an uncanny ear for dialogue and a witty, unflinching candor about sex, love, and power, Leslie Jamison reminds us that no matter how unexpected its turns, the life we’re given is all we have: the cruelties that unhinge us, the beauties that clarify us, the addictions that deform us, those fleeting possibilities of grace that fade as quickly as they come. <i>The Gin Closet</i> marks the debut of a stunning new talent in fiction.</p>",

The only karma Franny&#8217;s got is bad karma.<P>Then Franny gets her hands on a box of magic recipes that could fix all of her problems. It could even change the world! Finally, life is looking up.<P>But Franny is about to learn that magic and karma aren&#8217;t to be played with. When you mess with the universe, it can bite back in unexpected ways.<P>Ouch!</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Twelve-year-old Fanny is stressed&#58; her parents are divorced, her father is already dating, and her freaky New Age grandmother, who serves yak butter tea and talks about her past lives, has moved in. Franny also feels caught between hyper-segregated social groups (her two best friends have chosen different sides) at Jefferson Middle School. When Franny learns about Granny's Hindi help box of spells that she acquired from a lama she met during her world travels, despite Granny's warnings to be prudent, Franny tries to fix her problems using the spells, which end up working a little too well. Franny and Granny share a strong chemistry, and the book is peppered with deadpan humor and amusing hyperbole, though Franny's habit of comparing her problems to those of people in developing nations (I live in suburban Fall River, New Jersey, not Gaza. Must my life be so difficult on a daily basis?), might provoke eye rolling. The plot unravels from parody into implausible slapstick with the appearance of a hip lama and a Justin Timberlake cameo. A few too many ingredients sour a promising recipe. Ages 10 up. (Aug.)</p>",

      "synopsis": "<p>Sara is barely six years old when her beloved father unexpectedly vanishes from her life. Her mother, Ruth, a dreamy and reluctant housewife, is now left with three small children to bring up, and the knowledge that she will somehow have to pick up the pieces, if she is to survive and fend for the family. But Sara takes up a vigil at the window of their dismal apartment, refusing to accept that her father won't be coming back. To this bitter-sweet and moving tale of childhood and the loss of innocence, the best-selling author of Jephte's Daughter, Sotah, the Sacrifice of Tamar and The Ghost of Hannah Mendes, brings the added intensity of a personal memoir. This is Naomi Ragen at her best, her writing charged with a searing, emotional truth as she unravels a tale of childhood, betrayal and the unending resilience of family love.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Based on novelist Ragen's own experiences growing up in an ethnically mixed low-income housing project in the Rockaways, this novel opens a window into the bittersweet world of the Markowitz family as they struggle to make ends meet in 1950s New York City. A first-generation Jewish immigrant with incredible reserves of optimism and ambition, David Markowitz trades in his religious identity for the promised gold of America, believing that if you really wanted to, if you worked your can off, you could not only get out of Brooklyn, but get Brooklyn out of you. After being conned into making a bad investment that leaves him and his family financially and emotionally bankrupt, David dies suddenly. For the first time in her life, his wife, Ruth, must take sole responsibility for her three children, something that seems overwhelmingly difficult. Ruth manages to enroll her eldest son, Jesse, and her daughter, Sara, at a private Jewish day school. Sara embraces her educational and spiritual environment and finds hope and self-renewal in the form of her parents' lost religion. But Jesse, to his mother's dismay, refuses to attend the school and instead self-educates himself in business so that he can fulfill his father's vision of success. Terrorizing his mother with his unreasonable plans and propositions, he self-destructs. Ragen (The Ghost of Hannah Mendes; Sotah) elaborates on her usual themes, extolling the comforting power of faith in a hostile modern world. Working with familiar characters, plot and setting, she crafts a comforting if somewhat shopworn tale of family, hope, religion and the dark side of the American dream.

Jamesâs painful struggle with anxiety and depression-along with his ongoing quest to understand what led to his self-destructive sisterâs exile-make for a heart-rending read, but his wild, exuberant Whitmanization of the world and keen sense of humor keep this emotionally charged debut novel buoyant.</p>",

Drea&#8217;s mom and a rotating band of psychiatrists have settled on &#8220;a touch of Asperger&#8217;s.&#8221;<P>Having just moved to the latest in a string of new towns, Drea meets two other outsiders. And Naomi and Justin seem to actually <i>like</i> Drea. The three of them form a band after an impromptu, Portishead-comparison-worthy jam after school. Justin swiftly challenges not only Drea&#8217;s preference for Poe over Black Lab but also her perceived inability to connect with another person. Justin, against all odds, may even <i>like</i> like Drea. <P>It&#8217;s obvious that Drea can&#8217;t hide behind her sound equipment anymore.&#160;But just when she&#8217;s found not one but two true friends, can she stand to lose one of them?</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>A story of how it feels to be an outsider, Kelly's debut follows the complex and candid thoughts of 16-year-old Drea, who is diagnosed with ADHD and borderline Asperger's syndrome. She is highly intelligent, but certain tasks, such as driving, and social interactions are challenging (All I know is I make sense to me--it's other people who seem complicated, she says). When she and her flighty mother move to yet another town to live with her ornery grandmother Drea wants to crawl into her shell. But then she meets flamboyant, attention-seeker Naomi and sensitive Justin, both of whom share the burden of unstable families and imperfect pasts. The trio bonds over a mutual love for making trip-hop music and a desire to trust someone, but Naomi's taste for danger and drugs soon distances her from her new friends. While Naomi's self-destruction follows a predictable downward spiral, the novel's strength lies in Drea's dynamic personality&#58; a combination of surprising immaturity, childish wonder, and profound insight. Her search for stability and need to escape being labeled is poignant and convincing. Ages 14 up. (May)</p>",

Just when she thinks nothing else can possibly go wrong, an emergency whisks her parents away to Japan-right before harvest season. Summer and her little brother, Jaz, are left in the care of their grandparents, who come out of retirement in order to harvest wheat and help pay the bills.</p><p>The thing about Obaachan and Jiichan is that they are old-fashioned and demanding, and between helping Obaachan cook for the workers, covering for her when her back pain worsens, and worrying about her lonely little brother, Summer just barely has time to notice the attentions of their bossâs cute son. But notice she does, and what begins as a welcome distraction from the hard work soon turns into a mess of its own.</p><p>Having thoroughly disappointed her grandmother, Summer figures the bad luck <i>must</i> be finished-but then it gets worse. And when that happens, Summer has to figure out how to change it herself, even if it means further displeasing Obaachan. Because it might be the only way to save her family.</p>",

      "synopsis": "Wormwood (1890) Is A Novel By Marie Corelli. Published At The Beginning Of Corelli's Career As One Of The Most Successful Writers Of Her Generation, Wormwood Combines Realism, Social Commentary, And Family Drama To Tell A Story Of Murder, Revenge, And Addiction Set In The Bustling City Of Paris. Due For Reassessment By A Modern Audience, Marie Corelli's Work--which Has Inspired Several Adaptations For Film And Theater--is A Must Read For Fans Of Nineteenth Century Fiction. Men Such As 'gaston Beauvais' Are To Be Met With Every Day In Paris--and Not Only In Paris, But In Every Part Of The Continent Where The Curse, Which Forms The Subject Of This Story, Has Any Sort Of Sway. The Morbidness Of The Modern French Mind Is Well Known [...]; The Open Atheism, Heartlessness, Flippancy, And Flagrant Immorality Of The Whole Modern French School Of Thought Is Unquestioned. Intended As A Rallying Cry To English Readers, Wormwood States Quite Clearly Corelli's Beliefs On Progressivism And The Dangers Of Alcohol. Echoing The Popular Realist Novels Of French Contemporary Emile Zola, Corelli Provides A Gritty Portrait Of Ambition And Suffering In Paris. When Young Gaston Beauvais Is Betrayed By His Fiancée And Best Friend, He Turns From A Life Of Promise To The Promise Of Absinthe, Beginning A Tragic Spiral Into Violence And Despair. Addressing Philosophical, Psychological, And Religious Themes, Wormwood Is A Moving Work Of Fiction Which Asks Important Questions About An Emerging Modern World. With A Beautifully Designed Cover And Professionally Typeset Manuscript, This Edition Of Marie Corelli's Wormwood Is A Classic Work Of English Literature Reimagined For Modern Readers.",

When Maya's parents, Toni and Jacob, arrive for a visit - Maya's gone - where, no one knows. And Maya, for reasons of her own, leaves haunting clues in late-night calls to her brother at home, carefully avoiding detection by the two people who love her most. Ultimately, to find her, Toni and Jacob will have to revisit parts of their pasts that they had thought were gone forever and confront the person they have long feared most. A stunning portrait of familial love and how far we can drift apart in the moments between the words we speak, The Good Parents is at once utterly contemporary and a story as old as humanity itself.",

Her parents are getting a divorce, her family is moving, she has to share a room with WS (her Wicked Sister), and that is just the tip of her troubles. As the new girl in school, Sadie struggles to find a new social niche, complete with new VBF (Very Best Friend) and BBF (Best Boy Friend). By the fourth week of school, Sadie has found both of these essentials, even though she is socially not as popular as she would like to be. As school progresses, Sadie begins to realize that things and people are not always what or who they appear to be. Told in Blog style, complete with Clicktionary and comments from various bloggers, this book uses a popular teen mode of communication to delve into the complex issues of abusive boyfriends and depression. Sadie has an authentic teen voice, which allows readers to love her and root for her, even when you begin to hate what she is doing and who she is becoming. Despite the story line occasionally reading like an after school special, Dellasega still manages to write a book that will entertain and enlighten. Reviewer: Melissa Joy Adams</p>",

In New Orleans, Kristen believes she now has the opportunity to prove herself and forget a rather disastrous past relationship. But life is much harder than she expected in the Big Easy. Then she meets a man from her past, Rafe Crawford...a man battling his own demons and keeping his own secrets.\n<p>The beautiful, but down-to-earth Angelique Fleming has always had to fight to get what she wanted in a world dominated by men and she has the chip on her shoulder to prove it. Which is why she takes great pleasure working at a local strip club, hoping to expose a few naughty little secrets of the community's upstanding men. But before she gets all the dirt, she's going to find out a few things about life, men, and forgiveness she thought she already knew.</p>\n<p>Claudette Thibodeaux Laurent comes from old New Orleans money and had always adhered to the family code: honor above all else. But she shocks polite society when she marries a man much younger than herself, a man everyone suspects is only after her money. Claudette has done her duty to her family and now she wants a little happiness for herself. And yet doubts eventually begin to creep in and she isn't sure which Maurice loves more: her or her money, as his desire for the finer things in life become more and more lavish. Just exactly how much is her happiness is going to cost her?</p>\n<p>Told with Francis Ray's trademark emotion and passion, <i>Somebody's Knocking at My Door</i> is a powerful story of betrayal and forgiveness, love and healing.<br>\n</p>",

      "synopsis": "<p>My mother called me Silver. I was born part precious metal, part pirate. <br><br>Orphaned and anchorless, Silver is taken in by blind Mr. Pew, the mysterious and miraculously old keeper of the Cape Wrath lighthouse. Pew tells Silver ancient tales of longing and rootlessness, of journeys that move through place and time, of passion and betrayal. His stories center on Babel Dark, a local nineteenth-century clergyman who lived two lives: a public one mired in darkness and a private one bathed in a beacon of light. Pew's stories are, for Silver, a map through her own particular darkness, into her own story and, finally, into love.<p>With Lighthousekeeping, Winterson begins a new cycle and a return to the lyrical intimacy of her earliest work. One of the most original and extraordinary writers of her generation, Winterson has created a modern fable about the transformative power of storytelling.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>It's hard to believe that Winterson's latest novel is even more lightweight than her previous one, The PowerBook, but here an orphan's romantic memories of growing up in a Scottish lighthouse are stretched to the limit with coy aphorisms. When her mother is blown away-literally possible on the savage Atlantic coast of Salts, Scotland-young Silver is sent to live with the lighthouse keeper at Cape Wrath, kind blind old Pew, who spins yarns, especially one about an early minister of Salts, Babel Dark, a Jekyll-and-Hyde type who's acquainted with contemporaries Darwin and Robert Louis Stevenson, and who cruelly betrays the woman he loves twice. When Silver grows up, Pew is discharged from his lighthouse duties in the name of progress, and trusty Silver sets off to look for him, ending up in Capri obsessed with a talking bird. Winterson attempts several stories within stories, switching narrators frequently, and relies heavily on the metaphor of storytelling as elucidation. While Dark's hubris is duly gothic, and the fondness between Silver and Pew touching, the narrative overall feels weightless, without cohesion or fixed purpose. Some of Winterson's off-kilter reflections on love and storytelling are striking, but too many have become convenient truisms: A beginning, a middle and an end is the proper way to tell a story. But I have difficulty with that method. Agent, Suzanne Gluck at William Morris. 6-city author tour. (Apr.) Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.</p>",

      "synopsis": "When Darashikoh Shezad gets himself fired from his banking job in Lahore, he begins a decline that plummets the length of this sharply drawn, subversive tale. Before long, he can't pay his bills, and along with his electricity he loses his toehold among Pakistan's cell-phone-toting elite. As the jet set parties on behind high walls, Daru descends into drugs and dissolution. For good measure, he falls in love with the wife of his childhood friend and rival, Ozi--beautiful, restless Mumtaz, to whom he is drawn with the obsessive intensity of a moth circling a candle flame.\n<p>Desperate to reverse his fortunes, Daru embarks on a career in crime, taking as his partner Murad Badshah, the notorious rickshaw driver, populist, and pirate. When a long-planned heist goes awry, Daru finds himself on trial for a murder he may or may not have committed. The uncertainty of his fate mirrors that of his country, hyped on the prospect of becoming a nuclear player even as corruption drains its political will.</p>\n<p> Fast-paced, unexpected, and unfailingly entertaining, Moth Smoke portrays a contemporary Pakistan far more vivid and disturbing than the exoticized images of South Asia familiar to the West. His debut novel establishes Mohsin Hamid as a writer of substance and imagination.</p>",

      "synopsis": "<p>Dramatizing the very real plight of coal miners in the Pennsylvania anthracite fields in the 1870s, <i>Rebels in the Shadows</i> tells the story of the legendary secret society known as the Molly Maguires. The time is the explosive 1870s; the place, the hard-coal fields of Pennsylvania. The Flannery family, like all the others in Pottsville, barely eke out a living from the mines. Out of frustration and anger, a group of coal miners organizes a secret society to fight the coal mine operators. The mine owners strike back, resulting in atrocities on both sides. <p> In the midst of this upheaval, a charming stranger arrives in town. The newcomer, Red McKenna, quickly befriends fifteen-year-old Sean Flannery, and Sean's sister, Kitty, falls in love with him. But when raids by the Mollies are ambushed by the Coal and Iron Police, Red is suspected of being a spy for the mine owners. The violence escalates, and the Flannery family is left to deal with the consequences of one of the first truly tragic labor conflicts in America. <p> Intended for middle school readers, ages 11&#151;14, <i>Rebels in the Shadows</i> offers a historically accurate version of a tumultuous time in the Pennsylvania coal mines based on actual documents of the period. <i>Rebels in the Shadows</i> also tells the story of a young man dealing with the demands of adulthood, a father forced to change his beliefs, a mother coping with grief, a young woman discovering and losing love, and a stranger who must choose between duty and morality. Unlike many of the accounts of the period, Reilly has tried to depict opposing sides fairly, and the book offers another look at the plight of the Irish immigrant in America. <p> As with the other Golden Triangle Books, <i>Rebels in the Shadows</i> contains a foreword and an afterword on the historical themes and personalities in the novel.</p><h3>KLIATT</h3><p>In the 1870s, the coal miners in the hills of Pennsylvania were at the mercy of the mine owners. They worked under deplorable conditions and almost everything in the town was owned by the men who ran the mines. Rebels in the Shadows presents the Flannery family&#151;Mike, the father who tries to do his best; fifteen-year-old Sean, who loses his older brother to violence; and Kitty, the sister who falls for the town stranger who turns out to be a Pinkerton detective. It is also the story of the Molly Maguires&#151;a secret society based on violence that gradually led the way to peaceful coal miners' unions. Greenhorn on the Frontier tells of Harry and his sister Sukey, who leave home to farm 500 acres in rural Pennsylvania. They meet an unscrupulous woodsman who tries to take their land away, and Sukey falls for the blacksmith who has two slaves even though she is violently opposed to slavery. The novel also deals with Virginia and Pennsylvania and their border disputes. Golden Triangle Books has a Web site that you can access to give you additional material to use with the books in the classroom. For instance, with Rebels in the Shadows, the site gives you lesson plans, family activities, and information on coal and coal mining, labor and labor unions, and child labor. For Greenhorn on the Frontier, there is information on the Revolutionary War, the Shawnee, agriculture and farming, as well as a bibliography of further reading. The books are recommended for ages 9 to 14, but they can definitely be used for high school-age reluctant readers. The historical facts are accurate and the writing will interest even those who are not history buffs. KLIATT Codes&#58; J&#151;Recommended for juniorhigh school students. 1962, Univ. of Pittsburgh Press/Golden Triangle, 185p, 21cm, $12.95. Ages 13 to 15. Reviewer&#58; Barbara Jo McKee; Libn/Media Dir., Streetsboro H.S., Stow, OH, September 2000 (Vol. 34 No. 5)</p>",

      "synopsis": "<p><P><p>Pemba knows she's not crazy. But who is that looking out at her through her mirror's eye? And why is the apparition calling her friend? Her real friends are back home in Brooklyn, not in the old colonial house in Colchester, Connecticut, where none of this would have happened if Daddy were still alive. But now all Pemba has is Mom and that strange old man, Abraham. Maybe he's the crazy one. <p> <p>Thank goodness for Pemba's Playlist and the journal she keeps. There are so many answers deep inside that music. So much is revealed in Pemba's poetry -- the bops she writes and those coming through her iPod. Phyllis, an 18th-century slave girl, has answers too. But Phyllis's reality billows out from her visits to Pemba, visits that transform both girls in ways neither expected. <p> <p>In this supernatural tale, the voices of these two characters entwine to put a new spin on a paranormal story. As a mystery unfolds, many truths are revealed -- about honesty, freedom, redemption, and friendship. <p> <p>Excerpt&#58; <p> <p>Miles of highway and nothin <p>but trees. Mom's movin me to Nowhere, <p>CT when I used to live in the center of the universe&#58; <p>Brooklyn, NY. This must be some kind of evil curse. . . . <p><p>I'm journalin like my hand's on fire, ear buds blarin&#58; <p>~Pemba <p> <p> <p>The truth everywhere evident&#58; <p>my days are numbered in our happy home. <p>The only home I know. <p> <p>Both in here and out there, I am invisible. . . <p>~Phyllis <p></p><h3>Children's Literature</h3><p>In this slim book, Nelson and Hegamin join forces to depict the powerful encounter between two girls separated by over two centuries. Pemba is a moody, disaffected, modern-day teen, forced by her widowed mother to move away from her lively life in Brooklyn to a centuries-old, long-abandoned house in a small town in Connecticut. Phyllys is a slave girl who once lived in the house, witness to a terrible and never prosecuted crime. What the two girls have in common is that they express their deepest and otherwise inexpressible feelings through poetry&#151;and that each needs the other desperately. Pemba's first-person narration, written by Hegamin, makes up most of the book; three-time National Book Award finalist Nelson generates the subtle, slant-rhymed sonnets of Phyllys. The novel makes historical research seem urgent and riveting, as Pemba searches for answers to explain her communications with Phyllys by digging through the library archives of Colchester, Connecticut, together with its historian, Abraham (the real-life history buff who inspired these two authors to come together to write this book). And the novel makes poetry seem, not the stuff of an English class assignment, but the eloquent voice of real girls who communicate with each other across the divide of centuries. This is a highly original and striking collaboration. Reviewer&#58; Claudia Mills, Ph.D.</p>",

The story begins with a detective making love to his young, beautiful client. A month earlier, she had hired him to trail her husband, but they quickly became lovers. When the client asks him to kill her husband, the detective quickly realizes that he had been used—seducing him was only a step in her plan to end her husband’s life. The detective declines her offer, but when she proposes to double his fee if he continues trailing the husband, he agrees. It seems like a simple enough proposition, but when he follows the husband on a business trip to Florida, his simple plan becomes complicated when he and the husband sit down to talk. But the complications don’t stop there. Through a strange turn of events, the detective finds himself trapped by the husband and the only chance for freedom is the very act the detective wanted to avoid: he must kill the husband’s wife. Full of suspense and intrigue, The Raw Essentials of Human Sexuality reveals that there is much more beneath the surface of these marital problems—lives are at stake for the sake of power and sex.",

      "synopsis": "The Ground Rules were impossible to follow. It was hard not to become completely consumed by the beautiful and enigmatic Weston Hanson. The heart of a romantic was not fit for this kind of exchange. So, when it ended, I was shattered, but it was all for the better…or so we thought.  The Ground Rules were rewritten, and then bent. We lied to ourselves. We told ourselves we could handle this. Not a single one of us realized just how big this was...just how devastating it could become. And now, there are no Rules. We are undone. Lust… infatuation…blinds you. It can tear everything apart. But sometimes, life needs to be completely torn apart before it can be mended – not just cracked at the edges, but utterly shattered, before you can truly see the mess you’ve become. I love them both, but I can’t have them both. While one pulls me in, the other pushes me away. And when both eventually open their hearts, I must make the hardest decision of my life.",

      "synopsis": "He's an author with an image problem. She's an image consultant with an author problem. Let the battle of wills begin… Manhandling from award winning romantic comedy author Sami Lee will keep you laughing from start to finish. Brisbane, Australia will never be the same after Libby Allison does a little manhandling! Jake McCallum was a corporate go-getter once upon a time, before his father's health issues forced him to reassess his addiction to life in the fast lane. When his fiancé subsequently dumped him, he decided a quiet, uncomplicated life working as a mechanic in his dad's garage was the way to go. Now his return to the dating world has motivated him to write a book about his disastrous love life, and it looks like he's on the path to success once more. The trouble is, he's not sure he wants to get back on the fast track. Image consultant Libby Allison has been hired to whip Jake into shape in preparation for his coming book tour, and the second she gets a load of Jake's stained T-shirts and shaggy hair, she knows an image overhaul is well overdue. She's hoping to find more high-profile clients, and a makeover like the one she has planned for Jake could generate just the word of mouth she needs. If only Jake wasn't so averse to every little change she tries to make. And if only she wasn't wildly attracted to him, despite his aggravating views on women and relationships. Find out if their chemistry beat out their common sense? This contemporary romantic comedy contains a battle of the sexes and is not intended for readers under the age of 18.",

      "synopsis": "Spaceport Mercy is a very dangerous place in the far reaches of space and for Corvan Jareth it’s just become even more dangerous! Deadly Pleasure, by award winning sci-fi paranormal author Lexxie Couper, Book 2 of her Spaceport Mercy series, is a thrilling adventure of assassins, artificial intelligence, and secrets from the past. You won’t be able to put this one down as danger and passion collide! No one on Spaceport Mercy knows who Corvan Jareth really is. Everything about the bouncer at The Steam, the port's most popular bar, is shrouded in mystery. The only certainty-don't piss him off if you value your limbs. And definitely don't mess with Emylie, his equally mysterious companion, if you value your life. That's all anyone knows, and that's the way Corvan likes it. So who's the woman in skintight red leather who suddenly appears on Port Mercy? The one with the massive partner known only as Forty-Two? The one asking questions about the secretive bouncer? And why do her eyes burn with familiar hunger when she finally finds him? Corvan Jareth's dark past is about to catch up with him. And it couldn't be more dangerous. Or erotic. *Not intended for readers under the age of 18.> *Previously Published: (2008) Changeling Press | (2013) Ellora's Cave",

When he wins an all-expense paid trip to Hawaii, he sits next to a beautiful woman on the flight, and it’s anything but love at first sight. Victoria is extremely gorgeous, wealthy beyond belief, and arrogant.\n\nAt twenty-six, she already conquered the business world, but she has failed miserably in her personal relationships. On the flight to Hawaii, she seems almost repelled by Arthur. Once they land on the island, she even suspects he’s stalking her—and she accuses him of such after two days of dancing around each other. She slaps him, and he kisses her.\n\nA sexual odyssey begins as two strangers embark on an erotic trip to the dark side neither of them is prepared to handle. As the sex takes a surprising turn, they must agree on a set of rules for their relationship while maintaining their normal lives: business trips, parents, and jobs. Despite distractions, their shared passion binds them together in more ways than one.",

As a necromancer who works with the police, she communicates with murder victims to bring their killers to justice.

She moves to London hoping to find work as a maid, but soon finds herself working for a madam who intends to sell off Fanny’s virginity. Though she is at first fearful of contact with men, Fanny soon learns the ways of extracting enjoyment and pleasure from sex. Written in the form of a confession, the novel follows Fanny as she works her way up in society while witnessing all manner of sexual encounter.   First published in 1749, Fanny Hill was banned for obscenity and became nearly impossible to find for centuries.

Amanda is bored with life. She spends hours a day on Facebook, her parents act like they are too ancient to enjoy life any longer, and her military husband, Ralph, is deployed to Afghanistan. Gideon is not totally content at home either. His wife, Nina, is a lifetime overachiever and a workaholic. She has moved her mother into their home so she can have a live-in sitter, and Gideon has fallen to the bottom of her priority list. On Black Friday 2012, both Amanda and Gideon end up at a Best Buy to take advantage of the massive price cuts. When the store opens its door at midnight, the potential customers rush the glass doors and end up in a brawl. Built-up excitement turns into mass pandemonium as the police show up in riot gear. Tear gas containers are being tossed around like lollipops and strangers are beating on each other like a heavyweight fight at the MGM Grand in Vegas. Amanda and Gideon both end up in the skywalk overlooking the madness and, even though they are complete strangers to each other, the adrenaline rush overwhelms them and they discover quick ecstasy among the chaos. After putting their clothes back on, followed by making formal introductions, they embark on a sexual journey together that re-ignites the flames in their souls. Both are forced to make choices that they never thought would have to be made; marriages are placed at risk; heartbreak is inevitable. What starts out merely as casual sex becomes much more than mere physical attraction and their lives begin to unravel.

When Constance Wright arrives at her family's summerhouse on the Mediterranean island of Santerre for her father Ross's memorial, she hopes that boyfriend Jim, the New York investment banker on her arm, will boost her status in the family. Between her ravishing sister, Isabelle; her ageless French stepmother, Odette; and her English stepsisters, former model Lucy and famous artist Jane, there's a lot of competition for attention -- not to mention double beds. ...Now it's time to sink or swim. What she hadn't counted on is the attraction Jim develops for one of the other women in the house...and the affinity she feels for the mysterious writer who moves in next door. As liaisons shift and tension soars, Constance finds that she's not the only one in the house whose love life is in turmoil. Complicating matters is the discovery of a Swiss bank account that Ross left behind. Now, the women of this eclectic family are about to learn more than they ever wanted to know about each other, their father, and themselves.",

She tries to remember her mother's voice and the pitch and treble of it passes through her; the rhythm of it so clear that for a moment they are...connected by frail strings. So begins The Land of Women, and we are swept into Fiona O'Faolain's last summer in Ireland, the season of her burgeoning sexuality. It is a time, too, when mother and daughter step toward friendship among the voluminous gowns they make for local brides. Yet that giddy summer also delivers betrayal. Fiona's journey from the shame that ended her girlhood takes her to Santa Fe and to Carlos Aragon, a restorer of antiquities, whose ancestry is mysteriously linked to hers. As he explores their pasts with the precision of an artisan, Fiona must face her excruciating memory. In The Land of Women the past lives in the present, and physical and emotional geography touch.",

She flits through a string of temp jobs in funky thrift store clothes. But beneath her veneer of quirky humor there's a nagging feeling of dissatisfaction about her life. She's about to go bananas. When Junie meets Eliot, who is twice her age, and his cat, Alfie, at the vet's office, she's convinced she's found the zest missing in her life. A burnt-out sci-fi writer in search of a muse, Eliot is apples to Leon's oranges. It's not long before Junie's standing in his kitchen being offered a banana...and then some. Losing herself in the mayhem of a fling, Junie slowly realizes that kinky diversions are a poor distraction from what's really eating her. Only when she stops obsessing about Eliot and starts peeling away the layers of her family's past will she see that what she really wants has been waiting for her all along...and that her future's ripe with possibilities.",

Following the breakout success of The Hoodwives Series, cowritten with De’nesha Diamond, Real Wifeys was a snappy, sexy page-turner that introduced readers to Goldie, a misguided young woman who becomes a modern-day madame. Get Money brings us Luscious Jordan, a minor character in Real Wifeys, who now takes center stage and whose strong will and ruthlessness surpass even Goldie’s. Goldie’s former business partner, rapper Make $, is serving hard time in prison for her brutal rape. His former wifey, Harriett “Luscious” Jordan, finds herself out in the cold as his family and friends close ranks to protect his money. A first-rate hustler, Luscious builds a successful business as a party promoter. Yet the force that truly drives her is a blind ambition to destroy Goldie, who had stolen Make $ from her. Now Luscious is tormented by her blazing desire for payback: how far can she go in her bitter quest for revenge without destroying herself too? In this powerful cautionary tale about the dangers of hatred and vengeance, fans of street literature will get a bold dose of Mink’s authentic urban voice in a hood tale that reads with breathless passion.",

      "synopsis": "A lady’s companion and a roguish matchmaker trade quips—and glances—in this steamy Regency romance by the award-winning author of The Viscount’s Promise. Miss Rosalind Merriweather’s life has been one of hardship and servitude since her late sister’s ruination. Now a paid companion, her latest post brings her to London to watch over the daughter of a social climbing harridan. She vows to protect her charge―and her own heart―from rakes and libertines, the very type of man who destroyed her sister. This vow proves difficult when Sir Tristan Crosby, the epitome of all she despises, begins to show attention to the girl. Tristan has spent decades perfecting his easygoing, charming persona to hide the damage done by years of abuse by his father. Finding he has a talent for matchmaking, he fills some of the emptiness inside him by helping the overlooked, shy women of London find true love. However, the latest young woman has a watchdog of a companion who seems to see beyond his careful façade to the flawed, uncertain soul he strives to hide from the world. Even worse, she affects him in ways no woman ever has. But he will not give up his matchmaking, even for one such as her. What he does not expect is for Rosalind to be fired from her position because of it―nor that she will immediately find a position in his own household. When these two headstrong adversaries meet under one roof, will their attraction to one another lead to heartbreak, or have these two passionate souls finally met their match? “A sweet, emotional Regency romance…simmering passion and lively, intelligent dialogue.” —Kirkus Reviews",

Sexy and thuggish, Alexander Maples, a.k.a. Daddy Long Stroke, is a womanizer. Arrogant and self-indulged, he is what every woman secretly craves in the bedroom—rough, rugged, and ravenous. And he is always happy to deliver. Alexander knows no boundaries when it comes to pleasing a woman, leaving no area untouched, not even her heart—or her wallet. But love is the last thing on his mind. Getting paid, and whetting his sexual appetite are the only things that motivate this salacious gigolo. And any woman trying to claim him finds herself on the receiving end of heartache, tears, and drama. Written in raw, graphic language, Daddy Long Stroke is a cautionary tale of one man’s insatiable thirst for sex and his quest to bed down as many women he possibly can—no matter the costs, and no matter who gets hurt in the process.",

      "synopsis": "In this story of erotic temptation and total surrender, a powerful man gives his dream girl a new beginning.   Running from a troubled past, Sandra Barry spent years hiding out in New York City, finding satisfaction and even a sense of community as a sub at a large BDSM dungeon. But when a stalker joins the dungeon posing as a Dom, he crosses her personal boundaries, giving her no choice but to return home to Arizona. Seeking refuge once again in the kink lifestyle, Sandra meets a sexy new Dom whose tutelage drives her wild—although there’s something familiar about him she just can’t place.   As a teenager, Brent Weston was a nerd. Now he owns the hottest dungeon in Phoenix, enjoying the power and success he’s always craved. All that’s missing is the right woman to share it with. Then one day Sandra, his secret high school crush, walks into his club. She’s just as beautiful as he remembers. She’s also scared as hell. Brent has been waiting for this moment, and now that Sandra’s in his sights, he’ll do anything to protect her, pleasure her—and prove that he’s the only master worthy of her devotion.

Get ready for a thrilling adventure in Hollywood. Sex tapes, blackmail, and a secret life set the stage for this hot, erotic romance. Everyone in Hollywood has a sex tape, but when A-lister Sasha Brazil receives the blackmail note and a copy of a video showing her kneeling and begging to submit she knows she's in trouble. With her reputation on the line, and her secret life as a submissive in jeopardy, she turns to her lawyer for help, never guessing that the quiet, reserved Emory is a Dom. Emory would never have guessed that Sasha—known for her roles as a tough action star—was a submissive. While he works to unmask the blackmailer, Emory takes Sasha on as a submissive. Together they begin a passionate BDSM relationship centered on Emory's specialty, role-play. The sexual relationship quickly morphs into something more, but Sasha has secrets, and when the man who turned Sasha into a submissive shows up even love may not be enough to save her.

Today, as it is translated into English for the first time, author Virginia Pesemapeo Bordeleau would rather call it a celebration of sensuality, another first. At a time when Indigenous peoples were being dispossessed of their land and history as well as their relationship to the body, the love explored by Wabougouni and Gabriel is an act of defiance. Their intimate connection plays out on the shores of Lake Abitibi in an affair as turbulent and unfathomable as the lake itself.</p><p>\"The aim here is to break free of the bonds of wounds the priests' abuse has left on our bodies and souls, wounds linked to loss--of land, of intimate spaces, of identity both as an individual and community member, of sexual identity, of delight in the body, of innocence and the uncomplicated nature of lovemaking. My hope is that this novel will serve to unearth the seed of joy buried deep in our culture, still profoundly alive . . . <i>The Lover, the Lake</i> shows us that we are not just suffering and victims: we can also be pleasure.\" -- Virginia Pesemapeo Bordeleau, from the prologue",

Set in a future where the threat of terrorism has seeped into everything, an American soldier finds himself at the vanguard of America's latest war. After a terrorist attack on the White House, America invades an African country in the Sahara. In the desert, the soldier begins to realize that memory itself can be used as a form of terrorism. Years later, as a soldier in the war, he finds himself thinking a woman who he isn’t entirely sure is real, who had once miraculously appeared when he was growing up and told him of an impossible paradise. He yearns for both the woman and that paradise. In the Sahara, he sees horrors that seem to be the work of demons. After a year of war, his mind and soul are on the verge of collapse; by the time he sees the woman from his childhood marching through the desert, he has no choice but to surrender to his fantasies. In a world devastated by war and terrorism, only she gives him hope. When she again disappears, he is ready to move heaven and earth to find her. However, it is a quest that seems to have consequences for both his soul and America's. Intimate Relations with Strangers explores the nature of reality, war, and love in such a way that “readers will remember this powerful, fable-like work of protest long after they’ve turned the last page” (Publishers Weekly, starred review).",

Find out in this erotic ménage romance from international bestselling contemporary romance author Lexxie Couper. Compliance is Book 2 in Lexxie's bestselling Heart of Fame - Stage Right series. When the competition heats up, the nerd and the jock soon discover the lady has other ideas. Courage is sexy… The last time Bethany Sloan was in Australia, she helped two guys fall in love with each other. This time, it looks like she's about to be responsible for two guys beating the hell out of each other. Not exactly how she'd planned to spend her long-overdue vacation, that's for sure. Especially when what she'd really like to do is have wild, wicked sex with both of them. At the same time. Because a threesome with a sexy nerd and a sexy jock is her idea of a perfect fantasy. And then her heart gets involved. Damn it… IT guru and self-made billionaire Logan Hill wants the hot little American who strides into his best mate's bar the second he lays eyes on her. The trouble is, his best mate—and the man who once saved Logan's life—falls instantly in lust with her as well. Logan would give his right arm for Curtis, but the moment Bethany Sloan smiles at them both, Logan is a goner. Sometimes a nerd's got to get the girl, right? Curtis Clarkson never pulls punches. And he always gets what he wants. It's been that way since he was the captain of the school's cricket team, and has been that way ever since. Retired from captaining the Australian cricket team, Curtis spends most of his time running his bar. When your life is a scrutinized by the media as his is, sexual relationships bring nothing but trouble. And then the sexy American tourist walks into his club, with her sexy accent and her sexy attitude, and Curtis wonders if it's time to rethink that stance. But what the hell does he do when introverted, woman-shy Logan makes it clear he's interested in Bethany as well? Bethany's got a solution. One neither guy has considered. One beneficially pleasurable to all. She's just got to convince them to see things her way. After all, two hot Aussie guys are better than one at going Down Under… *Not intended for readers under the age of 18. *Previously Published: (2014) 5x5 Publishing.",

In these vivid tales of lust without limits, the lines are blurred between fantasy and reality, propriety and necessity. There are no boundaries or taboos, only needs to be fulfilled. Here women and men risk everything in pursuit of sexual satisfaction—and business always mixes with pleasure.",

      "synopsis": "Five best friends find their happily ever afters in these five books featuring geeky heroines and the possessively sweet heroes who will move the world for the women they love. Looking For It - Sadie I know better than to hook up with my brother's best friends, but they've made me an offer I can't refuse. Can we cross that line without ruining the friendships we already have? Waiting For It - Anne My best friend's brother, my boss... the two men I spend my days working with and my nights fantasizing about.  When I find out they're doing the same, my world is turned upside down. When I learn their seduction is part of a bet, my world is shattered. Asking For It - Lyn I don't care that the two gorgeous men in the coffee shop give me obviously fake names when they hit on me. I don't expect to ever see them again. Then they show up in my shop the next days--it turns out they're the persistent jerks trying to buy my business out from under me.  Running For It - Violet I walked away from the man I loved because the person his political career required him to be in public wasn't the same as the man behind closed doors. But a night with him and his best friend reminds me how much I miss their company. I can't walk away again, but I can't play by the same rules they do. Fighting For It - Luna When the media paints me as a hacking super villain, the only way to redeem myself is to step into the spotlight and prove them wrong. But the men I'm falling for are as publicity averse as I am, and my newly-found fame could shatter our world. Author's Note: This set contains books 1-5 in the Three Player Co-op series.

      "synopsis": "<div>Pierre Loti's <I>Madame Chrysantheme</I> is a charming story, a real life tale of love between the Frenchman Pierre Loti and a geisha. At times the story is happy, at other times it is sad. The setting is a summer in Nagasaki almost a century ago. Loti, as a young naval officer on station in harbor, had sufficient time on his hands to establish a home ashore with fragile and beautiful Madame Chrysantheme. In these days of fast jet travel such romances are scarcely possible for travelers, yet the appeal of them remains.<BR><BR>Here is a novel based on a real experience written by one of France's greatest masters of description. The theme is love in the exotic Japan of the late nineteenth century. At times the scenario resembles comic opera in the vein of Gilbert and Sullivan's Mikado, but at other times emotional feeling runs as deep as in Puccini&#8217;s Madame Butterfly. The mixed denizens of the Nagasaki waterfront and the teahouses of those long-ago days provided Loti with very rich material indeed. This is a book all lovers of the romantic side of traditional Japan will be sure to appreciate.<BR></div>",

      "synopsis": "Hope and Faith: two things that everyone needs to survive—but the words take on a different meaning in the form of a set of twins who attend Crockett University in Washington, D.C. Soror Ride 'em High and Soror Lick 'em Low, originally hail from Atlanta and, like most twins, they share a connection. In fact, their physical bond is so strong, that one can often feel a pounding while the other is engaged in sexual activity. But everything is not perfect when it comes to being a twin. Sometimes animosity and jealousy can creep in; especially when Hope and Faith find themselves both attracted to the same man on campus. Is blood really thicker than water? Or, in this case, thicker than basic carnal desires? In this long-anticipated second volume in the APF series, a follow-up to The Sisters of APF: The Indoctrination of Soror Ride Dick, New York Times bestselling author Zane once again proves why she is the Queen of Erotic Fiction. Over the years many have tried to emulate her but Zane's imagination is not to be replicated any time in the near future. The freak nights of APF are some of the most artistic, exhilarating, erotic experiences that have ever graced the pages of a book; evidenced by the thousands of emails Zane has received over the years from women yearning to join the sorority. The sexual revolution continues within the pages of Head Bangers: An APF Sexcapade.",

Wielding a six-shooter and shrieking feminist slogans from atop the grand piano, the impassioned lady makes a startling first impression on those gathered, especially Rathe -- and from that moment the sparks between them only intensify. Irrepressible Grace O'Rourke, an intensely devout feminist, has outraged the entire town of Natchez with her radical ideas, and soon infuriates Rathe with her lack of regard for any opinions other than her own. Yet, despite her steadfast devotion to her cause, Grace warms to the virile gallant. But his bold suggestion of becoming his mistress stings the proud Grace, and she firmly rejects his scandalous proposition. But telling a Bragg \"no\" is the ultimate stimulant, and now, Rathe ardently pursues the lady whose eyes are ignited by a violet fire. Enjoy the entire Bragg saga --",

But, as A Heart for the Work makes clear, Malawian medical students learn to confront poverty creatively, experiencing fatigue and frustration but also joy and commitment on their way to becoming physicians. The first ethnography of medical training in the global South, Claire L. Wendland's book is a moving and perceptive look at medicine in a world where the transnational movement of people and ideas creates both devastation and possibility.Wendland, a physician anthropologist, conducted extensive interviews and worked in wards, clinics, and operating theaters alongside the student doctors whose stories she relates. From the relative calm of Malawi's College of Medicine to the turbulence of training at hospitals with gravely ill patients and dramatically inadequate supplies, staff, and technology, Wendland's work reveals the way these young doctors engage the contradictions of their circumstances, shedding new light on debates about the effects of medical training, the impact of traditional healing, and the purposes of medicine.<br></p>",

Young Peter Duvett has accepted a job as an assistant to the elusive portraitist, Vienna Linn, in the remote town of Churchill, Manitoba. Peter's life is about to change in ways he scarcely could have imagined. Across Canada, Linn has been arranging and photographing gruesome accidents for the private collection, in London, of a Mr. Radin Heur-theirs is a macabre duet of art and violence. <br>\n<br>\nAfter a strenuous journey, Peter arrives in Churchill on the very night of his employer's wedding only to fall under the spell of Vienna's brilliant and beautiful wife, Kala Murie. Several months later, the uneasy menage a trois moves to Peter's native Halifax. Peter is drawn more and more deeply to Kala as he reluctantly comes to share her obsession with \"spirit pictures,\" photographs in which the faces of the long-dead or forgotten mysteriously appear --and as he sees more and more terrifying scenes come to life in the darkroom.<br>\n<br>\nHoward Norman's <i>The Haunting of L.</i> is a chilling fable of moral blindness and artistic ambition, from a writer of \"complexly tragic vision\" (Richard Bernstein, <i>The New York Times</i>).<br>",

In December 1930, just before Christmas, the Gibbsville, Pennsylvania, social circuit is electrified with parties and dances. At the center of the social elite stand Julian and Caroline English. But in one rash moment born inside a highball glass, Julian breaks with polite society and begins a rapid descent toward self-destruction.</p>\n<p>Brimming with wealth and privilege, jealousy and infidelity, O’Hara’s iconic first novel is an unflinching look at the dark side of the American dream—and a lasting testament to the keen social intelligence if a major American writer.<br>\n &nbsp;</p>",
